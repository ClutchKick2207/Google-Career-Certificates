	- **Linear**
		- The previous task or previous phase has to be completed before the next task can start
		- Works well in something such as building a house (i.e. things have to be done to continue)
			- Create the blueprint
			- Have to know exactly how the house looks like before laying down the foundation, then you can put down bricks
		- Works when there is a clear goal
			- Know exactly how a house will look like
			- Unlikely that changes in mind will happen, so you can be more rigid, and more efficient
		- Less flexible
		- Need to complete each step in order, and stick to agreed upon results
	- **Iterative**
