## My Notes
> My notes for this overall course will be laid out by module in the course, and have subheadings in order to differentiate between different topics/videos that are presented in the courses. I'll add in any extra notes/resources that I use where necessary, and hope it will be helpful for anyone looking!


## Introduction to project management methodologies
> [!info] Project Management Methodology - Definition
> A set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle
- **Project management methodologies**
	- **Linear**
		- The previous task or previous phase has to be completed before the next task can start
		- Works well in something such as building a house (i.e. things have to be done to continue)
			- Create the blueprint
			- Have to know exactly how the house looks like before laying down the foundation, then you can put down bricks
		- Works when there is a clear goal
			- Know exactly how a house will look like
			- Unlikely that changes in mind will happen, so you can be more rigid, and more efficient
		- Less flexible
		- Need to complete each step in order, and stick to agreed upon results
	- **Iterative**
		- Some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on
		- Works well in something that can change constantly such as a TV show
			- Comes up with an idea
			- Run tests to see if it will be good
			- Get feedback
				- Adjustments are made
			- Concurrently can work on other parts of the project
			- Like hiring permanent actors, starting film production
		- Overall goal is clear, although actual product may be different to original idea
		- Therefore is useful to have some form of flexibility, as you can find better ideas, or remain flexible if the client wants to make changes
		- As this is a more open ended goal, it is vital to be able to use feedback to be able to produce a better overall product

## Overview of Waterfall and Agile
- **Overview of Waterfall and Agile**
	- **Waterfall**
		- **Info**
			- Sequential ordering of phases
			- Complete one at a time, down the line
				- Like a waterfall starting at the top of the mountain to the bottom
			- Linear approach
			- First used in physical engineering disciplines
				- Such as manufacturing and construction
			- Then used in software engineering projects as well
			- Used a lot currently
				- In product feature design
				- Application design
			- Event planning and retail also use Waterfall
			- Waterfall styles all follow an ordered set of steps that are directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources and goals (that are not likely to change)
			- By planning the entire project up front, you are planning for success
				- Help you identify the right people and tasks
				- Plan accordingly to avoid any hiccups along the way
				- Create room for documenting plans and progress
				- Enable you to hit the goal
		- **Phases**
			- Initiating
			- Planning
			- Executing
			- Closing
		- **When to use**
			- When the phases of the project are clearly defined
			- When the tasks have to be done sequentially (i.e. one has to be done for the other to happen)
			- When changes are difficult/expensive, and therefore are unlikely to occur
		- **Example**
			- Catering project, on a very tight budget
				- *Steps*
					- Confirm number of guests
					- Very clearly define menu
					- Get approval and agreement on menu items and cost
					- Place order on ingredients
					- Feed guests
				- As the budget is limited, you cannot afford to waste any food or budget
				- Therefore by making it rigid, you can be efficient, but lose out on any flexibility (which avoids you being sidetracked)
				- Won't allow the client to change the menu when the order is placed
				- Can choose exactly how much of everything you need because you know exactly how many people are going to be there, and what kind of food is being prepared
	- **Agile**
		- **Info**
			- Able to move quickly and easily, and also willing and able to change and adapt
			- Many tasks that are being done at the same time, or in various stages of completion
			- Iterative approach
			- Used initially in the development of software
			- More of a mindset that just a series of steps
				- Concerned with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client, so they can deliver the best value, as quickly as possible, and adjust as changes are observed
		- **Phases**
			- Initiating
			- Planning
			- Executing
			- Closing
			- *Note*
				- Agile projects overlap, and these can be done out of order as well
				- Done in iterations, which in Scrum are referred to as Sprints
				- *Sprints*
					- Short chunks of time (1-4 weeks) where the team works on completing specific tasks
		- **When to use**
			- When the client has an *idea* of what they want, but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind
			- Have a set of qualities they want to see, but aren't concerned about what it exactly looks like
			- Levels of high uncertainty and risks in the project
