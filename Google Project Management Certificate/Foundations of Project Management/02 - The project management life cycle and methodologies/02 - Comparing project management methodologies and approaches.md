## Introduction to project management methodologies
> [!info] Project Management Methodology - Definition
> A set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle
- **Project management methodologies**
	- **Linear**
		- The previous task or previous phase has to be completed before the next task can start
		- Works well in something such as building a house (i.e. things have to be done to continue)
			- Create the blueprint
			- Have to know exactly how the house looks like before laying down the foundation, then you can put down bricks
		- Works when there is a clear goal
			- Know exactly how a house will look like
			- Unlikely that changes in mind will happen, so you can be more rigid, and more efficient
		- Less flexible
		- Need to complete each step in order, and stick to agreed upon results
	- **Iterative**
		- Some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on
		- Works well in something that can change constantly such as a TV show
			- Comes up with an idea
			- Run tests to see if it will be good
			- Get feedback
				- Adjustments are made
			- Concurrently can work on other parts of the project
			- Like hiring permanent actors, starting film production
		- Overall goal is clear, although actual product may be different to original idea
		- Therefore is useful to have some form of flexibility, as you can find better ideas, or remain flexible if the client wants to make changes
		- As this is a more open ended goal, it is vital to be able to use feedback to be able to produce a better overall product
