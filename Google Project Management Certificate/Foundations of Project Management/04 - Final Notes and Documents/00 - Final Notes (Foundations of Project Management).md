## The Value of a Project Manager
> [!Info] Project Manager - Definition
> Shepherds projects from start to finish and serve as guides for their team, using their impeccable organisational and interpersonal skills every step of the way

> [!Info] Stakeholders - Definition
> People who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success
- **Value of a Project Manager**
	- What do they do?
		- Generally Involves
			- Planning and Organising
			- Managing Tasks
			- Budgeting and Controlling costs
		- ...all so the project can be done in the approved timeframe
	- Adds Value through key areas
		- **Prioritisation**
			- *Project managers add value to their teams and organisations through effective prioritisation of tasks required to complete a project*
			- Communicate with the team and stakeholders in order to make a plan on what to do first and what order
			- Real life example
				- Painting a house
					- Picked out paint, and eager to get started
					- Although tempting, have to do other tasks, such as:
						- Laying out drop-cloths
						- Buying more supplies
						- Tape corners and edges
						- Cover furniture
					- Then you can paint
					- Other decisions such as new face plates for the light switches can come later in the process
						- or be switched out if not needed
					- By doing all of these things before actually painting, you are prioritising the steps of the project, and are able to overall be more efficient and be able to have less mistakes
			- By effectively prioritising tasks, you are able to set up your team (and yourself) for a better project outcome
		- **Delegation**
			- *Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organisations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work*
			- Allows for the project to be much more efficient
			- Real life example
				- Painting multiple rooms can take a long time
					- Therefore enlist a few friends to help
				- People
					- One of the friends has a lot of painting experience
						- ask this person to handle the more challenging aspects of the project
						- such as painting the ceiling, or the detail work
						- Schedule her to paint the moulding before another less experienced friend paints the walls
				- By delegating the tasks to those with appropriate skill, and ordering them appropriately as well, applies strength to the planning of the overall project
		- **Effective Communication**
			- *Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders*
			- Being transparent
				- Being up front with plans and ideas
				- Making information readily available
			- Keep in regular contact with the rest of the team and identifies areas where a team-mate need support
			- Real life example
				- Check in with friends periodically
				- Ask if they have enough paint/supplies to complete their task
					- By checking in regularly, you can see if you need to buy more paint before the can is empty, and no work can be done
				- Reach out to the landlord to let them know the days you will be working on the project
					- although not directly involved, the outcomes will affect their property, therefore important to keep them informed
			- Regular contact with people outside the team
				- company leaders that are invested in the project for example

		- "The only thing that never changes, is that everything changes"
		- Remain flexible to adjust to the stakeholder's needs
		- Protect team from constant change and rework
		- Document initial expectations of the project, and identify any changes being requested

## A Project Manager's role within a team
- **A project manager's role within a team**
	- A "Project Manager" is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team
		- Manages the *tasks* of a project
		- Therefore although you may have to manage teammates for a certain task/project, you are probably not their day-to-day boss
	- Everyone on the team will have their own set of roles and responsibilities
		- Each person will be an expert on their portion of the project, but no one will be an expert on every aspect of the project
	- Responsible for guiding your team
		- Making sure they have the support they need to complete the project
	- **How can this be done?**
		- "Hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks"
		- "Ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths"
		- "Understand and help teammates to adopt the right workflows and project management styles"
		- "Collaborate with other teams at the organisation to deliver solutions that meet the requirements based on project scope, schedule and budget"

## Working with cross-functional teams
- ![[Pasted image 20221227200515.png]]
> [!info] Cross-Functional Team - Definition
> A team, who's members have different backgrounds, types of expertise and job functions.
> 
- **Cross-Functional teams**
	- Members are sometimes referred to as "T-shaped" professionals
		- Skilled in how to collaborate and innovate with those in different job functions and different departments
		- Also contribute their own specific areas of expertise
		- Each member has their own unique perspective and experience, bringing different ideas and strategies to the project
	- How this can be done
		- **Clarify Goals**
			- Ensure that every team member understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project
			- Set clear goals. and make sure everyone understands those goals
			- **Define**
				- Budget
				- Deadlines
				- Quality requirements
				- Important resources
			- Continually check up on the team
			- All team members work together with the project manager to support the current project
		- **Get team members with the right skills**
			- Make sure that all the team members have the correct skills for each of the project functions
			- Make sure that the right people with the right skills are available
		- **Measure progress**
			- Showing your team how much they have accomplished can help them keep motivated
			- Take the time to measure and communicate the project's progress to the entire cross-functional team
			- **Measuring progress**
				- Key milestones
				- Completing project tasks
				- Meeting project goals on time and within budget
			- Document when tasks and goals are completed
			- Make sure to communicate if everything is on track, and if not, how to get there
		- **Recognise efforts**
			- Make sure that every member of the cross-functional team recognises their value
			- Also makes sure that everyone is considered to be a 'team', and equal

## The core skills of a project manager/Key Competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity
- **Core Skills**
	- ### **Enabling decision making**
		- **The core skills of a project manager**
			- The ability to enable decision making on the team, or gathering decisions from the appropriate leader is crucial to keep tasks on time, and achieve goals
			- Gather information from all the team-mates
				- Use that information to make informed decisions
				- Also make sure to communicate relevant stakeholders of decisions
					- such as the rest of the team and higher ups
			- Your job is to get all the relevant data to inform a decision between A and B
		- **Key Competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity**
			- Make the decision making process collaborative
				- Example
					- State the goals of specific deliverables
					- Elicit input from your team on how to achieve these goals
				- Your team members may think of ideas and solutions that you may not have thought about
				- Allows for you to focus on the over-arching management tasks, and prioritise them, while your team can focus on the details
	- ### **Communicating and escalating**
		- **The core skills of a project manager**

		- Includes
			- Budget
			- Breakdown of all necessary tasks
			- Ways to communicate team roles and responsibilities
			- Schedule
			- Resources
			- What to do if the project encounters any problems
	- **Execute and complete tasks**
		- Project team has the task of actually doing the tasks
		- Primary task is to monitor project, and to keep the team motivated
		- Remove any obstacles that might come up, so that tasks are executed well and on time
	- **Close the project**
		- Celebrate hard work
		- Evaluate how the project went
		- Take note of what went well, and what didn't
		- Connect with anyone outside of the team, and let use it as a networking opportunity
		- Note that some projects have a hard end-date (such as an election)
			- Some do not have as black-and-white of a end-date, and therefore needs to be clear when it is over in order to pass over to another group for example

## Case study: The significance of each project phase
![[Pasted image 20230107202909.png]]
- **Example**
	- **Consequences of rushing through a project phase**
		- Quickly throwing together a proposal (with rough estimates)
		- By not including engineers in the process, doesn't know that requires new software, and therefore will take a year longer than expected, and $800,000 budget wise
		- Is reprimanded
	- **What should have happened**
		- Although worried about the quick request, will spend the time to make the proposal properly
		- Is able to develop an accurate proposal, by involving engineers and other members
- **Project Lifecycle**
	- **Initiating the project**
		- Discuss project goals with stakeholders to get a clear idea of what they are asking for
		- After defining project goals, gather stakeholders and project team members to define what needs to be done

## Understanding Project Life Cycles
![[Pasted image 20230107232924.png]]

## Introduction to project management methodologies
> [!info] Project Management Methodology - Definition
> A set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle
- **Project management methodologies**
	- **Linear**
		- The previous task or previous phase has to be completed before the next task can start
		- Works well in something such as building a house (i.e. things have to be done to continue)
			- Create the blueprint
			- Have to know exactly how the house looks like before laying down the foundation, then you can put down bricks
		- Works when there is a clear goal
			- Know exactly how a house will look like
			- Unlikely that changes in mind will happen, so you can be more rigid, and more efficient
		- Less flexible
		- Need to complete each step in order, and stick to agreed upon results
	- **Iterative**
		- Some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on
		- Works well in something that can change constantly such as a TV show
			- Comes up with an idea
			- Run tests to see if it will be good
			- Get feedback
				- Adjustments are made
			- Concurrently can work on other parts of the project
			- Like hiring permanent actors, starting film production
		- Overall goal is clear, although actual product may be different to original idea
		- Therefore is useful to have some form of flexibility, as you can find better ideas, or remain flexible if the client wants to make changes
		- As this is a more open ended goal, it is vital to be able to use feedback to be able to produce a better overall product

## Overview of Waterfall and Agile
- **Overview of Waterfall and Agile**
	- **Waterfall**
		- **Info**
			- Sequential ordering of phases
			- Complete one at a time, down the line
				- Like a waterfall starting at the top of the mountain to the bottom
			- Linear approach
			- First used in physical engineering disciplines
				- Such as manufacturing and construction
			- Then used in software engineering projects as well
			- Used a lot currently
				- In product feature design
				- Application design
			- Event planning and retail also use Waterfall
			- Waterfall styles all follow an ordered set of steps that are directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources and goals (that are not likely to change)
			- By planning the entire project up front, you are planning for success
				- Help you identify the right people and tasks
				- Plan accordingly to avoid any hiccups along the way
				- Create room for documenting plans and progress
				- Enable you to hit the goal
		- **Phases**
			- Initiating
			- Planning
			- Executing
			- Closing
		- **When to use**
			- When the phases of the project are clearly defined
			- When the tasks have to be done sequentially (i.e. one has to be done for the other to happen)
			- When changes are difficult/expensive, and therefore are unlikely to occur
		- **Example**
			- Catering project, on a very tight budget
				- *Steps*
					- Confirm number of guests
					- Very clearly define menu
					- Get approval and agreement on menu items and cost
					- Place order on ingredients
					- Feed guests
				- As the budget is limited, you cannot afford to waste any food or budget
				- Therefore by making it rigid, you can be efficient, but lose out on any flexibility (which avoids you being sidetracked)
				- Won't allow the client to change the menu when the order is placed
				- Can choose exactly how much of everything you need because you know exactly how many people are going to be there, and what kind of food is being prepared
	- **Agile**
		- **Info**
			- Able to move quickly and easily, and also willing and able to change and adapt
			- Many tasks that are being done at the same time, or in various stages of completion
			- Iterative approach
			- Used initially in the development of software
			- More of a mindset that just a series of steps
				- Concerned with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client, so they can deliver the best value, as quickly as possible, and adjust as changes are observed
		- **Phases**
			- Initiating
			- Planning
			- Executing
			- Closing
			- *Note*
				- Agile projects overlap, and these can be done out of order as well
				- Done in iterations, which in Scrum are referred to as Sprints
				- *Sprints*
					- Short chunks of time (1-4 weeks) where the team works on completing specific tasks
		- **When to use**
			- When the client has an *idea* of what they want, but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind
			- Have a set of qualities they want to see, but aren't concerned about what it exactly looks like
			- Levels of high uncertainty and risks in the project
		- **Example**
			- Building a website
				- Build different parts of the website in sprints
				- Deliver each part to the client as they are built
				- Website can be launched with some parts (such as the main home-page), which other parts can be developed and added
				- Allows the team to get feedback early on about what works, and what doesn't, and adjust dynamically
				- Reduces wasted efforts
				- If using the Waterfall method, would require entire website to be made before launch, and may not be what the client wants

## Comparing Waterfall and Agile approaches
|                            | **Waterfall**                                                                                                                                                                            | **Agile**                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Manager's Role** | Project manager serves as an active leader by prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members.                                                                                          | Agile project manager (or Scrum Master) acts primarily as a facilitator, removing any barriers the team faces. Team shares more responsibility in managing their own work. |
| **Scope**                  | Project deliverables and plans are well-established and documented in the early stages of initiating and planning. Changes go through a formal change request process.                   | Planning happens in shorter iterations and focuses on delivering value quickly. Subsequent iterations are adjusted in response to feedback or unforeseen issues.           |
| **Schedule**               | Follows a mostly linear path through the initiating, planning, executing, and closing phases of the project.                                                                             | Time is organized into phases called Sprints. Each Sprint has a defined duration, with a set list of deliverables planned at the start of the Sprint.                      |
| **Cost**                   | Costs are kept under control by careful estimation up front and close monitoring throughout the life cycle of the project.                                                               | Costs and schedule could change with each iteration.                                                                                                                       |
| **Quality**                | Project manager makes plans and clearly defines criteria to measure quality at the beginning of the project.                                                                             | Team solicits ongoing stakeholder input and user feedback by testing products in the field and regularly implementing improvements.                                        |
| **Communication**          | Project manager continually communicates progress toward milestones and other key indicators to stakeholders, ensuring that the project is on track to meet the customer’s expectations. | Team is customer-focused, with consistent communication between users and the project team.                                                                                |
| **Stakeholders**           | Project manager continually manages and monitors stakeholder engagement to ensure the project is on track.                                                                               | Team frequently provides deliverables to stakeholders throughout the project. Progress toward milestones is dependent upon stakeholder feedback.                           |                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma
- **Lean Six Sigma**
	- **Info**
		- Combination of two parent methodologies (Lean and Six Sigma)
		- Good for projects where the goals are to
			- Save money
			- Improve quality
			- Move quickly through process
			- Team collaboration
			- Positive work environment
		- When the team feels valued, motivation and productivity increases
		- For improving a current process to fix complex or high risk problems
			- Like improving sales, conversions or eliminating a bottleneck
	- **Phases (DMAIC)**
		- Strategy for process improvement by finding where problems are, and fixing them
		- **Define**
			- Define project goal, and what it will take to meet it
			- Similar to Initiation phase
			- Example
				- Streamline customer wait times
					- Define the project goal, and talk to stakeholders about expectations for the project
					- Take average wait times down to below 10 minutes, from over 30 minutes
		- **Measure**
			- Measure how the current process is performing
			- Focus on data
			- Map out the current process, and locate where the current problems are
			- What kind of effect does the problem have on the process?
			- Make a plan on how to get the data, and how often to measure it
			- Example
				- Why is it taking so long for the company to address a customer service issue
				- Look at company data
					- Average wait times
					- Number of customers per day
					- Seasonal variations
					- Set a plan on how to get the data, and how often to measure it
						- Have the company generate a report weekly
						- Surveys from staff and customers
						- Inventory reports
		- **Analyse**
			- Identify gaps and issues
			- Data analysis is very important
			- Example
				- Not enough staff on the busiest days
		- **Improve**
			- Make sure to go through all the previous steps to avoid mistakes
			- Present findings and get ready to start making improvements
			- Example
				- Recommend to hire more staff during the busiest hours

## Lean and Six Sigma methodologies
- **Lean** (Lean Manufacturing)
	- **Info**
		- Main principle is the removal of waste during an operation. (i.e. make things more efficient)
		- *Types of waste (manufacturing)*
			- Defects
			- Excess processing
			- Overproduction
			- Waiting
			- Inventory
			- Transportation
			- Motion
			- Non-utilized talent
		- *Issues that arise from the above waste*
			- Lack of proper documentation
			- Lack of process standards
			- Not understanding the customer's needs
			- Lack of effective communication
			- Lack of process control
			- Inefficient process design
			- Failures of management
	- **When to use**
		- Use Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits
	- **Lean 5S quality tool**
		- **Sort**
			- Remove all items not needed for current production
			- Leave only bare essentials
		- **Set in order**
			- Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use
			- Label items so anyone can find them/put them away
		- **Shine**
			- Keep everything in the correct place
			- Clean workspace daily
		- **Standardise**
			- Perform the process the same way every time
		- **Sustain**
			- Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline into the team
	- **Kanban**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230108182523.png]]
		- A scheduling system where you are able to optimise the flow of work
		- Uses cards that are moved from left to right in order to show work being done, and coordinate work
		- Kanban boards and Lean 5S are core parts of the Lean methodology
- **Six Sigma**
	- **Info**
		- Methodology used to reduce variations, by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time
		- Six Sigma originates from statistics, whereby items or processes should have 99.9996% quality
	- **Key principles (7)**
		- Always focus on the customer
		- Identify and understand how work gets done. Understand how work really happens
		- Make your processes flow smoothly
		- Reduce waste and concentrate on value
		- Stop defects by removing variation
		- Involve and collaborate with your team
		- Approach improvement activity in a systematic way
	- **When to use**
		- Find aspects of the product of process that are measurable, such as time cost or quantity
		- Inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard
- **Lean Six Sigma**
	- Discovered that two methodologies work well together
	- **Lean**
		- *Tools*
			- Kanban
			- 5S
		- Build quality in processes from the beginning
		- Products developed using Lean methods are tested using Six Sigma
		- Optimises processes
	- **Six Sigma**
		- Products are tested against the principles, where anything that passes continues, and those that do not are rejected
		- Reduces variation in products, and makes sure that quality standards are met

## Common project management approaches and how to select one
- **Popular project management approaches**
	- **Waterfall**
		- A traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner
		- Each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. 
		- The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. 
		- In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.
	- **Agile**
		- Involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. 
		- Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. 
		- In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. 
		- Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.
	- **Scrum**
		- An Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. 
		- Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.
	- **Kanban**
		- A tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts.
		-  With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”
	- **Lean**
		- uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes.
		-  Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. 
		- Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.
	- **Six Sigma**
		- Involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time.
		- The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC
			- stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.
	- **Lean Six Sigma**
		- A combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches.
		-  It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. 
		- Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. 
		- The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach.

## Overview of Classic and Matrix structures
> [!info] Organisational Structure - Definition
> The way a company or organisation is arranged or structure
- **Organizational Structure and Culture**
	- **Organisational Structure**
		- Sense of who reports to who
		- Who does what
		- Map where you fit in, who you should communicate to, and how often to communicate with them
		- **Organisational Heirarchy**
			- Generally mapped using a Reporting chart or Organisational chart
				- *Reporting Chart*
					- Details who reports to who, and goes up that chain
			- **Classic Structure**
				- Functional or top-down structures
					- CEO -> Directors -> Direct reports -> Direct reports -> etc.
					- ![[Pasted image 20230115185029.png]]
					- Each manager generally oversees teams which have a specific function
						- such as marketing, accounting, human resources
					- Take example of the army
						- ![[Pasted image 20230115185111.png]]
						- Having a strict hierarchy, where you report up the chain of command
					- If a similar structure is evident where you are working, you would probably end up speaking with your manager (i.e. the person above you), and with peers (same kinds of projects)
			- **Matrix Structure**
				- Grid
					- People above you, although people adjacent to you, who also expect to hear from you about different projects
					- ![[Pasted image 20230115185320.png]]
					- May not be direct bosses, although important to give any information that you have gained to them, as they can inform changes to your work

## A project manager's role within different organisational structures
- **Organisational Structures**
	- **Classic Organisational Structure**
		- Top-down heirarchy system
			- CEO has direct authority of several department managers
			- Department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees
			- Communication is needed both up and down the ladder
			- Authority comes from the top, and filters to the bottom
			- Requires reporting up the chain
			- Will generally stay within their own chain of command, and rarely go outside of it for teams, or guidance
			- Have to report to functional managers
		- **Functional Organisations**
			- Organisation is divided into departments based on function
			- Each department is led by a functional manager, and employees are grouped depending on the functions of their role
		- **Classic Organisational Structure Org chart**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230115190038.png]]
	- **Matrix Organisational Structure**
		- [The Matrix Organizational structure article (PMI)](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837)
		- Employees generally have 2 or more managers
		- People above you, as well as those in adjacent departments
			- Have to communicate and progress and work with as well
		- Functional areas cross paths, and the responsible manager for each area generally has the most authority
		- In the below diagram, think about how you have to go left for a manager there, and those next to you are adjacent, as well as up, where you have the board and CEO
		- **Matric Organsiational Structure Org Chart**

		- Need to rely on getting approval from appropriate managers
		- These people are also in charge of people on your team, and have the resources you need
		- Depend on the managers in your organisation to approve resources
			- The amount of resources and budget for project is decided by the managers
		- Chain of approval
			- Budget increase example
				- Report to manager
				- Manager reports to their management chain
			- Traditional top-down arrangement of authority and resources
	- **Matrix Structure**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230115191512.png]]
		- Two or more managers they need to report to and work with to function
		- Team mates will have their functional managers as well as you as their managers
		- If members are working on multiple projects, may also have multiple managers
		- Affects your authority as a project manager
			- You may have to collaborate with other managers to make decisions
			- Share resources
			- Negotiate priorities
			- Make sure you know who your stakeholders are
		- No clear chain of command
			- Make sure you have identified and communicated, with anyone you need approval from well before the project is due to begin
		- Strong project focus, and therefore have strong autonomy, and are able to gather resources as needed.

	- **Understand your target role**
		- Stand out against candidates that already have experience in the field
		- Understand the role in the context of any company you are applying to
	- **Analyse job listings**
		- Gather information from job listings
		- **Pull up ten job descriptions for your target role**
			- Use job boards such as Indeed, Glassdoor and LinkedIn
			- Make sure the roles come from different companies, share similar titles, and are roles you would actively apply for
			- Should be able to identify a section listing requirements for the role
		- **Combine the job requirements**
			- Create a document and copy over all the required responsibilities from all ten job descriptions
		- **Order requirements based on appearance frequency**
			- The more common it is, the more likely it is essential for the role
			- Put these requirements on the top of the list
		- After this, you should have a clear understanding of the potential requirements for the role
		- **Questions + Answers**
			- **Why do requirements different across job descriptions?**
				- Overly general job titles, or job titles that are not able to deliver the specific scope for the company
				- Program manager at one company maybe more focused on customer management, and another more on project management
				- Important to look beyond job titles and look at the job description to target roles
			- **Why are some requirements higher on my list than I thought they would be, while others I expected to see barely show up at all?**
				- May need to spend more time learning what the role really entails
				- May have some preconceptions that need adjusting
				- Do some additional research on other job options
			- **How do I know if I am really right for my target role?**
				- The more roles you look at, the more you can see if you are ready for the role, and get over any self doubt, especially as it is your first in a new field
		- **Create professional inventory**
			- Look at your existing professional qualifications
			- **Technical (hard) skills**
				- Related to a specific task or situation such as programming, technical writing, project management, etc.

		- **Match your profile to the job requirements**
			- Make it easy for a hiring manager to see why you are a good fit for the role
			- Go through professional inventory, and highlight every item in green, orange or red depending on your target role
			- **Highlighting Guidelines**
				- **Green**
					- Used for skills that are directly relevant for your target role
					- Should look for roles that emphasise these skills
					- Highlight these skills on your resume, and be prepared to discuss them in an interview
				- **Orange**
					- Should be used to identify skills and experiences that are relevant, but not necessarily directly
					- Transferable skills (i.e. things you bring in from past jobs)
					- Plan to explain this to hiring managers, as their relevance may not be immediately seen
				- **Red**
					- Used to identify items that are not relevant for your job search
					- De-prioritise these skills, and do not highlight them in your resume, and do not focus on them in interviews
			- Be sure to add on how you think it is relevant with any experience to resume
