				- Overly general job titles, or job titles that are not able to deliver the specific scope for the company

				- May have some preconceptions that need adjusting
				- Do some additional research on other job options
			- **How do I know if I am really right for my target role?**
				- The more roles you look at, the more you can see if you are ready for the role, and get over any self doubt, especially as it is your first in a new field

			- Go through professional inventory, and highlight every item in green, orange or red depending on your target role
			- **Highlighting Guidelines**
				- **Green**
					- Used for skills that are directly relevant for your target role
					- Should look for roles that emphasise these skills
					- Highlight these skills on your resume, and be prepared to discuss them in an interview
				- **Orange**
					- Should be used to identify skills and experiences that are relevant, but not necessarily directly
					- Transferable skills (i.e. things you bring in from past jobs)
					- Plan to explain this to hiring managers, as their relevance may not be immediately seen
				- **Red**
					- Used to identify items that are not relevant for your job search
					- De-prioritise these skills, and do not highlight them in your resume, and do not focus on them in interviews
			- Be sure to add on how you think it is relevant with any experience to resume
