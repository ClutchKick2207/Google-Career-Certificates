## Overview of Classic and Matrix structures
> [!info] Organisational Structure - Definition
> The way a company or organisation is arranged or structure
- **Organizational Structure and Culture**
	- **Organisational Structure**
		- Sense of who reports to who
		- Who does what
		- Map where you fit in, who you should communicate to, and how often to communicate with them
		- **Organisational Heirarchy**
			- Generally mapped using a Reporting chart or Organisational chart
				- *Reporting Chart*
					- Details who reports to who, and goes up that chain
			- **Classic Structure**
				- Functional or top-down structures
					- CEO -> Directors -> Direct reports -> Direct reports -> etc.
					- ![[Pasted image 20230115185029.png]]
					- Each manager generally oversees teams which have a specific function
						- such as marketing, accounting, human resources
					- Take example of the army
						- ![[Pasted image 20230115185111.png]]
						- Having a strict hierarchy, where you report up the chain of command
					- If a similar structure is evident where you are working, you would probably end up speaking with your manager (i.e. the person above you), and with peers (same kinds of projects)
			- **Matrix Structure**
				- Grid
					- People above you, although people adjacent to you, who also expect to hear from you about different projects
					- ![[Pasted image 20230115185320.png]]
					- May not be direct bosses, although important to give any information that you have gained to them, as they can inform changes to your work

## A project manager's role within different organisational structures
- **Organisational Structures**
	- **Classic Organisational Structure**
		- Top-down heirarchy system
			- CEO has direct authority of several department managers
			- Department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees
			- Communication is needed both up and down the ladder
			- Authority comes from the top, and filters to the bottom
			- Requires reporting up the chain
			- Will generally stay within their own chain of command, and rarely go outside of it for teams, or guidance
			- Have to report to functional managers
		- **Functional Organisations**
			- Organisation is divided into departments based on function
			- Each department is led by a functional manager, and employees are grouped depending on the functions of their role
		- **Classic Organisational Structure Org chart**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230115190038.png]]
	- **Matrix Organisational Structure**
		- [The Matrix Organizational structure article (PMI)](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837)
		- Employees generally have 2 or more managers
		- People above you, as well as those in adjacent departments
			- Have to communicate and progress and work with as well
		- Functional areas cross paths, and the responsible manager for each area generally has the most authority
		- In the below diagram, think about how you have to go left for a manager there, and those next to you are adjacent, as well as up, where you have the board and CEO
