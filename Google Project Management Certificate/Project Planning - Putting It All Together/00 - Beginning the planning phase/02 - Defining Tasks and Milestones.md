## The importance of setting milestones
- **Importance of setting milestones**
	- Setting millstones gives a clear understanding of the amount of work that the project will require
		- Setting milestones forces you to break the project up into more manageable chunks
		- The further you separate, the easier it will be to do this.
	- Breaking a deliverable into milestones, and those milestones into deliverables allows for a much more manageable workload
	- Keeps the project on track
		- Assign clear deadlines for when project deliverables must be completed.
	- Helps uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet goals
		- If reaching a milestones takes more tasks than predicted, can ask to reduce the scope to stakeholders
	- Reaching milestones can seriously motivate the team, and illustrate real progress to stakeholders
		- As big projects may take months, important to keep motivation high to keep productivity high
	- Milestones serve as a great check-in point to highlight progress to stakeholders
	- Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order
		- As milestones later in the pipeline require ones before to be completed
	- If a deliverable tied to a specific milestone, it could set back your project schedule
		- Team might need to work overtime to catch up
