## Activity: Complete a stakeholder analysis and power grid
- **Activity Overview**
	- *In this activity you will complete a stakeholder analysis and power grid.*
	- Important to understand how each stakeholder relates to your project
	- Completing a stakeholder analysis and power grid allows you to determine each stakeholder’s influence and potential impact on a project
		- Crucial to managing communications and expectations
- **Scenario**
	- You are the project manager at Office Green
		- A commercial landscaping company that specializes in plants and greenery for offices and other businesses. 
	- The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, and you will manage the launch. 
	- You and your team need to maintain trust and generate buy-in from your stakeholders. 
	- Some of your stakeholders include:
		- **Director of Product**
			- The Director of Product is the project sponsor. 
			- As the sponsor, they fully support the project, sign off on high-level decisions, and sometimes act as a resource for the team. 
			- They are deeply invested in the outcome of the project, but less involved with its day-to-day operations.
		- **Landscape Designer/Web Designer** 
			- This person has two roles at Office Green, and within the Plant Pals project.
			- In addition to their web design skills and knowledge of plants, they have strong relationships with a range of people across the company. 
			- The Plant Pals project could affect their role as Landscape Designer if it results in a pivot toward new services. 
			- If they don’t want their role to change, it could be harder to get their buy-in.
		- **Existing clients and their employees** 
			- The core customers for this product launch are Office Green’s existing clients and their employees. 
			- Their feedback can help Office Green improve the customer experience for the new service. 
			- Depending on their needs, some clients will be very interested in Plant Pals, while others will be less so. 
			- Lower-interest clients are unlikely to resist the project unless it impacts the existing product line.
		- **Office Green’s investors** 
			- The investors support Office Green financially, so the company wants to keep them happy. 
			- Likewise, because Office Green’s performance affects their investments, the investors want Plant Pals to succeed. 
			- However, they will not be directly involved in the project and it will not affect them before launch. 
			- They are therefore unlikely to oppose the project at this stage.
		- **Office Green’s receptionist** 
			- The receptionist will not be directly involved with the Plant Pals project. 
			- They will need to answer customer questions about the service later on, but don’t need to know many details until closer to launch. 
			- They have no major concerns about the project at this stage.
- **Instructions**
	- **Part 1: Understanding stakeholders with a stakeholder analysis**
		1. **Access the template**

			- *Questions*
				- How will the project outcomes affect the needs of each stakeholder?
				- Do you expect any resistance that could affect their buy-in?
			- Record in the Impact column
		6. **Determine each stakeholder’s level of power or influence**
			- How much influence does each stakeholder have over the project?
			- Consider information added in the "Involvement" and "Impact" columns
			- Record each stakeholder's influence as
				- **High** (H)
				- **Medium** (M)
				- **Low** (L)
		7. **Determine each stakeholder’s level of interest**

				- How involved is each stakeholder in the project on a daily basis?
				- How much will the project impact the needs of each stakeholder?
			- Record each stakeholder's interest as
				- **High** (H)
				- **Medium** (M)

	- **Part 2**
		1. **Place stakeholders in the power grid**
			- Go to second slide of the PowerPoint
			- Consider the power or influence ratings
			- Place in the appropriate place in the grid
			- High interest, High power stakeholders should go toward the upper-right corner
			- Low interest, low power stakeholders go towards the lower-left corner
		2. **Determine how to engage with stakeholders**
			- think about how you should engage with the stakeholders

		- The table lists information on each stakeholder’s role, resources, potential resistance, and engagement.
		- The table lists each stakeholder’s level of power or influence as low, medium, or high.
		- The table lists each stakeholder’s level of interest as low, medium, or high.
	- Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed power grid:
		- The grid contains all the stakeholders from your stakeholder analysis.
