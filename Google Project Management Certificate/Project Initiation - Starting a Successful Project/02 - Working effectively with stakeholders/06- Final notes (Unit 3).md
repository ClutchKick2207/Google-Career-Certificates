## Project Role Responsibilities
- ![[Pasted image 20230205134826.png]]

## Completing a stakeholder analysis
> [!info] Stakeholder buy-in - Definition
> The process of involving these people in decision making to hopefully reach a broader consensus  on the organisation's future
- **Stakeholder Analysis**
	- **Primary Stakeholders**
		- People who will benefit directly from the project's success
	- **Secondary Stakeholders**
		- People who are indirectly impacted by the project's success
	- Helps you see all the opportunities for success, and the risks
	- Allows for you to see which stakeholders are taking on which responsibilites
	- Helps include the right people in the important conversations
	- *3 key steps*
		- Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
		- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
			- **Influence**
				- Measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much this stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome
			- **Interest**
				- How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes?
		- Assess stakeholder's ability to participate and then find ways to involve them
	- **Power Grid**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205150811.png]]
		- 2x2 grid
		- Assign each stakeholder's level of importance to the project
			- Measuring their influence and interest
		- The higher their level of influence and interest, the more important
			- Without their support, will probably not be successful
			- **Key stakeholders**
				- Closely partner with them
		- Everyone gets a spot in the grid
		- Look above at the diagram, and treat as listed
		- **Template**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205150853.png]]
		- Different ways to involve stakeholders
			- Meet with some stakeholders every day
			- Some just periodic emails with updates
		- **Stakeholder buy-in**
			- Pay particular attention to high impact stakeholders
				- Keep them in the loop
				- Explain to them how this project will help them achieve their goals
				- Have their support later on when any issues come up
		- **Communicating with stakeholders**
			- If you have 1 main stakeholder
				- Likely to be highly important and influential
				- Needs constant communication
			- If you have numerous stakeholders
				- Not as involved in the day-to-day tasks
			- Overcommunicate early on so stakeholders can make decisions with as much information as possible
			- Send daily end of day progress emails
			- Think about the amount of project detail every stakeholder needs
			- Daily, weekly, monthly check-ins

## Prioritising stakeholders and generating their buy-in
- **Conducting a stakeholder analysis**
	- **Key Steps**
		1.  **Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts.** 
			- *Questions to ask* 
				- Who is invested in the project? 
				- Who is impacted by this project? 
				- Who contributes to this project? 
		2. **Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder**
			- Determine who your key stakeholders are. 
			- The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 
		3. **Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them.** 
			- **Active Stakeholders**
				- More opinions and touchpoints
			- **Passive Stakeholders**
				- Preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day
			- Just because some stakeholders don't participate as directly, doesn't mean they aren't important
			- Many different factors that can influence the stakeholder's ability to participate
				- Physical distance from the project
				- Existing workload
	- **Steering committee**
		- A collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project
		- Can influence multiple departments within an organisation
			- Potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager
	- **Visualising Analysis**
		- **Power grid**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205154232.png]]
			- Shows stakeholder interest in the project versus their influence over the project
			- Allows for evaluating how to manage their stakeholders
			- Used to determine the appropriate level of engagement required by the project team to gain the stakeholder's buy-in and trust
			- Make sure to take into account each individual project, as they all will be different
	- **Generating stakeholder buy-in**
		- Make decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require
		- **Tips**
			- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder
			- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team
			- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate

		- [We Asked the Project Management Community: What Steps Do You Take To Identify and Prioritize All Stakeholders at the Start of a Project? (pmi.org)](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/identify-prioritize-stakeholders-11408)

## Stakeholder Interviews
- **Suggested Questions**
	- What are your most important priorities/goals?
	-   How will this initiative/project support you and your most important priorities?
	-   What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?
	-   Here’s how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?
	-   What can I clarify for you?
	-   What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?
	-   What would success look like for you?
	-   Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative?
	-   What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
	-   Where do you see me getting support for this initiative? Facing resistance?
	-   What additional thoughts/questions do you have?

## Elements of a RACI chart
> [!info] RACI Chart - Definition
> Helps define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently
- **RACI chart**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230205213736.png]]
	- **RACI Chart principles**
		- **Responsible**
			- Those doing the work to complete the task
		- **Accountable**
			- Those making sure the work gets done
		- **Consulted**
			- Those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision makers
		- **Informed**
			- Those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete
	- **Role confusion**
		- *Unbalanced workloads*
			- Some people might be doing more or less work compared to other people on the team
		- *Unclear hierarchy*
			- People aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done
		- *Unclear ownership decisions*
			- Unsure who makes the final call on a project
		- *Overlapping work*
			- Multiple people are responsible for the same work
		- *Excessive communication*
			- Too much can make things more complicated
			- Cause information overload
				- Not too sure what to pay attention to
		- RACI can help resolve/avoid all this

## Building out a RACI chart
- **RACI Chart**
	- **Elements of a RACI chart**
		- **Responsible**
			- *Who gets the work done*
			- Those who are actually doing the work to complete the task
			- At least one is needed
			- Try and limit the amount of people you have assigned to "responsible"
				- Although you may need more than one
			- *Questions*
				- What department does the work fall under?
				- Who will perform the work?
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Task is to develop price points
				- Therefore will list Financial Analyst
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205215505.png]]
		- **Accountable**
			- *Who makes sure the work is done*
			- Only have one individual accountable for each task
			- Helps clarify ownership for the task
			- Ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable to the responsible party
			- *Questions*
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
			- May encounter a situation where the responsible party is accountable
				- Try and avoid this where possible to avoid confusion of ownership
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Head of finance will be assigned here
				- Has to make sure the project stays on budget and creates a profit anyways, so needs to approve the Financial Analyst's work
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205215751.png]]
		- **Consulted**
			- *Who gives input or feedback on work*
			- Have useful information to help complete the task
			- No maximum or minimum amount of people that can be here
			- Important that each person has a reason for being there
			- *Questions*
				- Who will the task impact?
				- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
				- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
			- Consulted people will be in frequent, two-way communication with the responsible party
				- Make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the goal efficiently and correctly
			- *Office Green example*
				- Have the director of product be consulted
				- As they oversee all product offerings
					- Have knowledge about the product, and any potential changes, and how this can affect price points
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205220213.png]]
		- **Informed**
			- *Who needs to know the outcome*
			- Just need to know the final decisions, and when the item is completed
			- Common to have many people assigned to this role
			- Will not be asked for feedback
				- so make sure that anyone here only requires status updates and does not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the task
			- As a lot of people may be in this section, make sure it is not labour intensive to get  the information out
				- Something as simple as a read only version of the planning document is good
			- *Questions*
				- Who cares about this task’s completion?
				- Who will be affected by the outcome?
			- *Office Green*
				- Let the sales team know what has been happening, and also keep them informed on any progress
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205220509.png]]
	- **RACI chart example**
		- One a bit above is an example
		- Here is another one
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205215156.png]]

## Getting the most out of a RACI chart
- **RACI charts**
	- **Definition and Structure**
		- Determining the graph allows for you to keep in control of the project
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205224851.png]]
	- **Workload balance**
		- Try not to assign too many tasks to one stakeholder
		- Good idea to go back and track how many "R"s are assigned to each stakeholder
		- Helps you avoid overloading a single member in the team
		- A RACI chart can help mitigate single points of failure (aka *Silos*, where knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on a single person)
			- Therefore distribute tasks to avoid burnout
		- Try not to rely just on top performers to keep the project moving forward
			- If you find yourself doing so, step back and revaluate your team
	- **Put your RACI into practice**
		- Share RACI with sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and it signed off
		- When you get stakeholder buy-in, can set clear expectations for the team, and make sure everyone is aligned with their responsibilities
		- Document your team and stakeholder's acknowledgement of expectations through the project charter, meeting notes and in the RACI
		- Makes sure to continually check in with stakeholders and your team
	- **When should you use a RACI chart?**
		- Use it for larger, more complex projects
		- Might just slow down smaller projects
		- Projects which have a large amount of stakeholders would benefit
		- Even if you don't use it, it allows for a much larger level of understanding
			- Can help for a better project management experience

## Why Projects fail: Initiation missteps
- **Projects failing: Initiation Mistakes**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230205232303.png]]
	- **Unclear expectations**
		- *Questions*
			- What is the end goal?
			- What are the expected deliverables and schedule?
			- What is the budget?
			- Who are the stakeholders?
		- Not taking the time at the beginning of the project to answer these questions can bring headaches down the line
	- **Unrealistic expectations**
		- Although good to impress managers, try not to be too unreasonable from the start
		- Give yourself enough time and resources to complete the task comfortably
		- Understand the requirements before agreeing to any deadline
		- Best practice is to not commit to any firm deadlines while initiating to avoid setting any unrealistic expectations
		- Will have more information and will be able to better manage expectations in the planning phase
	- **Miscommunication**
		- Clear communication is key
		- Make sure it is communicated in a timely manner
		- Make sure it includes pertinent information
			- Risks
			- Decisions made
			- Scope changes
		- Make sure it is sent to the correct stakeholders
		- Conduct a stakeholder analysis, and use a RACI chart
		- Don't have to cater to everyone, but have to set clear expectations about how communication will occur
		- Make sure to take some time to understand the communication needs of the team and stakeholders
		- Set expectations for communications early on, so that everyone can have a clear understanding of how you will all communicate
	- **Lack of resources**
		- Resources include
			- Team members
			- Budget
			- Materials
		- Without proper planning, resources can be over-tasked or depleted
		-  Have to account that staff can be juggling multiple things at the same time, and may not be able to dedicate their entire time to this one project
		- Make sure to accurately calculate project expenses, and have some buffer room where possible
	- **Scope Creep**
		- Make sure that you know exactly what is and what isn't expected from the project's work and deliverables
		- Defining scope helps identify any resources that are needed, any costs that can be associated with it, and the schedule
		- Some projects fail due to the scope of the project growing too much
		- Make sure that it is set very firmly, and meet with stakeholders to confirm exactly what is needed
		- Make sure to know who has the authority to approve scope changes, and document everything
