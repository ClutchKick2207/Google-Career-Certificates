## Building out a RACI chart
- **RACI Chart**
	- **Elements of a RACI chart**
		- **Responsible**
			- *Who gets the work done*
			- Those who are actually doing the work to complete the task
			- At least one is needed
			- Try and limit the amount of people you have assigned to "responsible"
				- Although you may need more than one
			- *Questions*
				- What department does the work fall under?
				- Who will perform the work?
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Task is to develop price points
				- Therefore will list Financial Analyst

		- **Accountable**
			- *Who makes sure the work is done*
			- Only have one individual accountable for each task
			- Helps clarify ownership for the task
			- Ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable to the responsible party
			- *Questions*
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
			- May encounter a situation where the responsible party is accountable
				- Try and avoid this where possible to avoid confusion of ownership
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Head of finance will be assigned here
				- Has to make sure the project stays on budget and creates a profit anyways, so needs to approve the Financial Analyst's work
