## Elements of a RACI chart
> [!info] RACI Chart - Definition
> Helps define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently
- **RACI chart**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230205213736.png]]
	- **RACI Chart principles**
		- **Responsible**
			- Those doing the work to complete the task
		- **Accountable**
			- Those making sure the work gets done
		- **Consulted**
			- Those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision makers
		- **Informed**
			- Those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete
	- **Role confusion**
		- *Unbalanced workloads*
			- Some people might be doing more or less work compared to other people on the team
		- *Unclear hierarchy*
			- People aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done
		- *Unclear ownership decisions*
			- Unsure who makes the final call on a project
		- *Overlapping work*
			- Multiple people are responsible for the same work
		- *Excessive communication*
			- Too much can make things more complicated
			- Cause information overload
				- Not too sure what to pay attention to
		- RACI can help resolve/avoid all this

## Building out a RACI chart
- **RACI Chart**
	- **Elements of a RACI chart**
		- **Responsible**
			- *Who gets the work done*
			- Those who are actually doing the work to complete the task
			- At least one is needed
			- Try and limit the amount of people you have assigned to "responsible"
				- Although you may need more than one
			- *Questions*
				- What department does the work fall under?
				- Who will perform the work?
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Task is to develop price points
				- Therefore will list Financial Analyst
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205215505.png]]
		- **Accountable**
			- *Who makes sure the work is done*
			- Only have one individual accountable for each task
			- Helps clarify ownership for the task
			- Ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable to the responsible party
			- *Questions*
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
			- May encounter a situation where the responsible party is accountable
				- Try and avoid this where possible to avoid confusion of ownership
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Head of finance will be assigned here
				- Has to make sure the project stays on budget and creates a profit anyways, so needs to approve the Financial Analyst's work
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205215751.png]]
		- **Consulted**
			- *Who gives input or feedback on work*
			- Have useful information to help complete the task
			- No maximum or minimum amount of people that can be here
			- Important that each person has a reason for being there
			- *Questions*
				- Who will the task impact?
				- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
				- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
			- Consulted people will be in frequent, two-way communication with the responsible party
				- Make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the goal efficiently and correctly
			- *Office Green example*
				- Have the director of product be consulted
				- As they oversee all product offerings
					- Have knowledge about the product, and any potential changes, and how this can affect price points
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205220213.png]]
		- **Informed**
			- *Who needs to know the outcome*
			- Just need to know the final decisions, and when the item is completed
			- Common to have many people assigned to this role
			- Will not be asked for feedback
				- so make sure that anyone here only requires status updates and does not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the task
			- As a lot of people may be in this section, make sure it is not labour intensive to get  the information out
				- Something as simple as a read only version of the planning document is good
			- *Questions*
				- Who cares about this taskâ€™s completion?
				- Who will be affected by the outcome?
			- *Office Green*
				- Let the sales team know what has been happening, and also keep them informed on any progress

## Getting the most out of a RACI chart
- **RACI charts**
	- **Definition and Structure**
		- Determining the graph allows for you to keep in control of the project
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205224851.png]]
	- **Workload balance**
		- Try not to assign too many tasks to one stakeholder
		- Good idea to go back and track how many "R"s are assigned to each stakeholder
		- Helps you avoid overloading a single member in the team
		- A RACI chart can help mitigate single points of failure (aka *Silos*, where knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on a single person)
			- Therefore distribute tasks to avoid burnout
		- Try not to rely just on top performers to keep the project moving forward
			- If you find yourself doing so, step back and revaluate your team
	- **Put your RACI into practice**
		- Share RACI with sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and it signed off
		- When you get stakeholder buy-in, can set clear expectations for the team, and make sure everyone is aligned with their responsibilities
		- Document your team and stakeholder's acknowledgement of expectations through the project charter, meeting notes and in the RACI
		- Makes sure to continually check in with stakeholders and your team
	- **When should you use a RACI chart?**
		- Use it for larger, more complex projects
		- Might just slow down smaller projects
		- Projects which have a large amount of stakeholders would benefit
		- Even if you don't use it, it allows for a much larger level of understanding
			- Can help for a better project management experience

## Why Projects fail: Initiation missteps
- **Projects failing: Initiation Mistakes**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230205232303.png]]
	- **Unclear expectations**
		- *Questions*
			- What is the end goal?
			- What are the expected deliverables and schedule?
			- What is the budget?
			- Who are the stakeholders?
		- Not taking the time at the beginning of the project to answer these questions can bring headaches down the line
	- **Unrealistic expectations**
		- Although good to impress managers, try not to be too unreasonable from the start
		- Give yourself enough time and resources to complete the task comfortably
		- Understand the requirements before agreeing to any deadline
		- Best practice is to not commit to any firm deadlines while initiating to avoid setting any unrealistic expectations
		- Will have more information and will be able to better manage expectations in the planning phase
	- **Miscommunication**
		- Clear communication is key
		- Make sure it is communicated in a timely manner
		- Make sure it includes pertinent information
			- Risks
			- Decisions made
			- Scope changes
		- Make sure it is sent to the correct stakeholders
		- Conduct a stakeholder analysis, and use a RACI chart
		- Don't have to cater to everyone, but have to set clear expectations about how communication will occur
		- Make sure to take some time to understand the communication needs of the team and stakeholders
		- Set expectations for communications early on, so that everyone can have a clear understanding of how you will all communicate
	- **Lack of resources**
		- Resources include
			- Team members
			- Budget
			- Materials
		- Without proper planning, resources can be over-tasked or depleted
		-  Have to account that staff can be juggling multiple things at the same time, and may not be able to dedicate their entire time to this one project
		- Make sure to accurately calculate project expenses, and have some buffer room where possible
