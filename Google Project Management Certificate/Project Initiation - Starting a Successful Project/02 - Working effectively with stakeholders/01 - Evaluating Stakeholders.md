## Completing a stakeholder analysis

- **Stakeholder Analysis**
	- **Primary Stakeholders**
		- People who will benefit directly from the project's success
	- **Secondary Stakeholders**
		- People who are indirectly impacted by the project's success
	- Helps you see all the opportunities for success, and the risks
	- Allows for you to see which stakeholders are taking on which responsibilites
	- Helps include the right people in the important conversations
	- *3 key steps*
		- Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
		- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
			- **Influence**
				- Measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much this stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome
			- **Interest**
				- How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes?
		- Assess stakeholder's ability to participate and then find ways to involve them
	- **Power Grid**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205150811.png]]
		- 2x2 grid
		- Assign each stakeholder's level of importance to the project
			- Measuring their influence and interest
		- The higher their level of influence and interest, the more important
			- Without their support, will probably not be successful
			- **Key stakeholders**
				- Closely partner with them
		- Everyone gets a spot in the grid
		- Look above at the diagram, and treat as listed
		- **Template**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205150853.png]]
		- Different ways to involve stakeholders
			- Meet with some stakeholders every day
			- Some just periodic emails with updates
		- **Stakeholder buy-in**
			- Pay particular attention to high impact stakeholders
				- Keep them in the loop
				- Explain to them how this project will help them achieve their goals
				- Have their support later on when any issues come up
		- **Communicating with stakeholders**
			- If you have 1 main stakeholder
				- Likely to be highly important and influential
				- Needs constant communication
			- If you have numerous stakeholders
				- Not as involved in the day-to-day tasks
			- Overcommunicate early on so stakeholders can make decisions with as much information as possible
			- Send daily end of day progress emails
			- Think about the amount of project detail every stakeholder needs
			- Daily, weekly, monthly check-ins

## Prioritising stakeholders and generating their buy-in
- **Conducting a stakeholder analysis**
	- **Key Steps**
		1.  **Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts.** 
			- *Questions to ask* 
				- Who is invested in the project? 
				- Who is impacted by this project? 
				- Who contributes to this project? 
		2. **Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder**
			- Determine who your key stakeholders are. 
			- The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 
		3. Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them. 
			- **Active Stakeholders**
				- More opinions and touchpoints
			- **Passive Stakeholders**
				- Preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day
			- Just because some stakeholders don't participate as directly, doesn't mean they aren't important
			- Many different factors that can influence the stakeholder's ability to participate
				- Physical distance from the project
				- Existing workload
