## Completing a stakeholder analysis
> [!info] Stakeholder buy-in - Definition
> The process of involving these people in decision making to hopefully reach a broader consensus  on the organisation's future
- **Stakeholder Analysis**
	- **Primary Stakeholders**
		- People who will benefit directly from the project's success
	- **Secondary Stakeholders**
		- People who are indirectly impacted by the project's success
	- Helps you see all the opportunities for success, and the risks
	- Allows for you to see which stakeholders are taking on which responsibilites
	- Helps include the right people in the important conversations
	- *3 key steps*
		- Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
		- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
			- **Influence**
				- Measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much this stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome
			- **Interest**
				- How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes?
		- Assess stakeholder's ability to participate and then find ways to involve them
	- **Power Grid**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205150811.png]]
		- 2x2 grid
		- Assign each stakeholder's level of importance to the project
			- Measuring their influence and interest
		- The higher their level of influence and interest, the more important
			- Without their support, will probably not be successful
			- **Key stakeholders**
				- Closely partner with them
		- Everyone gets a spot in the grid
		- Look above at the diagram, and treat as listed
		- **Template**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205150853.png]]
		- Different ways to involve stakeholders
			- Meet with some stakeholders every day
			- Some just periodic emails with updates
		- **Stakeholder buy-in**
			- Pay particular attention to high impact stakeholders
				- Keep them in the loop
				- Explain to them how this project will help them achieve their goals
				- Have their support later on when any issues come up
		- **Communicating with stakeholders**
			- If you have 1 main stakeholder
				- Likely to be highly important and influential
				- Needs constant communication
			- If you have numerous stakeholders
				- Not as involved in the day-to-day tasks
			- Overcommunicate early on so stakeholders can make decisions with as much information as possible
			- Send daily end of day progress emails
			- Think about the amount of project detail every stakeholder needs
			- Daily, weekly, monthly check-ins

## Prioritising stakeholders and generating their buy-in
- **Conducting a stakeholder analysis**
	- **Key Steps**
		1.  **Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts.** 
			- *Questions to ask* 
				- Who is invested in the project? 
				- Who is impacted by this project? 
				- Who contributes to this project? 
		2. **Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder**
			- Determine who your key stakeholders are. 
			- The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 
		3. **Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them.** 
			- **Active Stakeholders**
				- More opinions and touchpoints
			- **Passive Stakeholders**
				- Preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day
			- Just because some stakeholders don't participate as directly, doesn't mean they aren't important
			- Many different factors that can influence the stakeholder's ability to participate
				- Physical distance from the project
				- Existing workload
	- **Steering committee**
		- A collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project
		- Can influence multiple departments within an organisation
			- Potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager
	- **Visualising Analysis**
		- **Power grid**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205154232.png]]
			- Shows stakeholder interest in the project versus their influence over the project
			- Allows for evaluating how to manage their stakeholders
			- Used to determine the appropriate level of engagement required by the project team to gain the stakeholder's buy-in and trust
			- Make sure to take into account each individual project, as they all will be different
	- **Generating stakeholder buy-in**
		- Make decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require
		- **Tips**
			- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder
			- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team
			- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate
