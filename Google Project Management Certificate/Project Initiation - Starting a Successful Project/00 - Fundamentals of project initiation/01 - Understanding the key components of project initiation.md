## Why is Project initiation essential?
- **Project Initiation**
	- First step of the project
	- Well planned initiation allows for a strong foundation for the rest of the project
	- Often initiated to combat a specific issue from a business
	- Identify project goals, resources, etc.
		- During initial discussions with stakeholders
			- Ask the right questions
			- Determine criteria for project success with stakeholders
			- Identify project research
			- Do research
			- Determine resources
			- Clearly document
	- Identify the boundaries of the project
	- **If not initiated properly**
		- Without understanding project goals, may underestimate the resources needed/time needed
		- May not accomplish appropriate goals
		- Gain as much clarity during the initial phase, as it'll allow for saving time throughout the rest of the project
