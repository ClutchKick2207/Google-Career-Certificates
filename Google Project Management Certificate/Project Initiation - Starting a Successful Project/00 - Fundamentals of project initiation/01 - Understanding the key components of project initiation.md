## Why is Project initiation essential?
> [!info] Cost Benefit Analysis - Definition
> The process of adding up the expected value of a project - the benefits - and comparing them to the dollar costs
- **Project Initiation**
	- First step of the project
	- Well planned initiation allows for a strong foundation for the rest of the project
	- Often initiated to combat a specific issue from a business
	- Identify project goals, resources, etc.
		- During initial discussions with stakeholders
			- Ask the right questions
			- Determine criteria for project success with stakeholders
			- Identify project research
			- Do research
			- Determine resources
			- Clearly document
	- Identify the boundaries of the project
	- **If not initiated properly**
		- Without understanding project goals, may underestimate the resources needed/time needed
		- May not accomplish appropriate goals
		- Gain as much clarity during the initial phase, as it'll allow for saving time throughout the rest of the project
	- **Cost Benefit Analysis**
		- Work with stakeholders
			- **Benefits**
				- What value will this project create?
				- How much money could this project save our organisation?
				- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
				- How much time will be saved?
				- How will the user experience be improved?
			- **Costs**
				- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
				- What will be the one-time costs?
				- Are there any on-going costs?
				- What about long-term costs?
		- Benefits should always outweigh the costs of the project
