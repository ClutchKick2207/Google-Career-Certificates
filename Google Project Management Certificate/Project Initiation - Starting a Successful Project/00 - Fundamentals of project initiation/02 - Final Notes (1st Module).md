## Why is Project initiation essential?
> [!info] Cost Benefit Analysis - Definition
> The process of adding up the expected value of a project - the benefits - and comparing them to the dollar costs

- **Project Initiation**
	- First step of the project
	- Well planned initiation allows for a strong foundation for the rest of the project
	- Often initiated to combat a specific issue from a business
	- Identify project goals, resources, etc.
		- During initial discussions with stakeholders
			- Ask the right questions
			- Determine criteria for project success with stakeholders
			- Identify project research
			- Do research
			- Determine resources
			- Clearly document
	- Identify the boundaries of the project
	- **If not initiated properly**
		- Without understanding project goals, may underestimate the resources needed/time needed
		- May not accomplish appropriate goals
		- Gain as much clarity during the initial phase, as it'll allow for saving time throughout the rest of the project
	- **Cost Benefit Analysis**
		- Work with stakeholders
			- **Benefits**
				- What value will this project create?
				- How much money could this project save our organisation?
				- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
				- How much time will be saved?
				- How will the user experience be improved?
			- **Costs**
				- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
				- What will be the one-time costs?
				- Are there any on-going costs?
				- What about long-term costs?
		- Benefits should always outweigh the costs of the project

## Key components of project initiation
> [!info] Project Charter - Definition
> A document that clearly defines the project and its goals, and outlines what is needed to accomplish them
- **Project initiation parts**
	- **Goals**
		- The goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve.
		- Have to have clear goals
			- Determined by senior company leaders
	- **Scope**
		- Process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project
	- **Deliverables**
		- Products and services that you will create for your customer, client, or project sponsor
		- Project features and services
		- Documentation
		- i.e. anything that enables the goal of the project to be achieved
		- Can be tangible (Chapters of a textbook) and intangible (Software, scheduling systems)
	- **Success Criteria**
		- Standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching it's goals
	- **Stakeholders**
		- The people who both have an interest in, and are affected by, the completion and success of a project
		- Instrumental in the above steps
		- Often create the guidelines and authorise the project to happen in the first place
		- Understand the expectations early
		- Make sure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project
	- **Resources**
		- Budget
		- People
		- Materials
		- Other items you will have at your disposal
		- Think carefully about what resources you need initially
- **Project Charter**

	- Contains all the details of a project
	- Review the document with stakeholders to make sure you haven't missed anything

## Performing a cost-benefit analysis
- **Cost-benefit analysis**
	- **Benefits of a cost-benefit analysis**
		- Minimise risks
		- Maximise gains
		- Allows for clear communication with stakeholders
		- Uses objective data, and therefore can point out any biases, and keep out stakeholder self-interest
		- Reduces waste
		- Provides good justification for a project
	- **Guiding Questions**
		- **Benefits**
			- What value will this project create?
			- How much money could this project save our organisation?
			- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
			- How much time will it save?
			- How will it improve the customer experience?
		- **Costs**
			- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
			- What are the one-time costs?
			- Are there any ongoing costs?
			- What about the long term costs?
		- **Intangible Benefits** (Costs are the same but reversed)
			- **Customer Satisfaction**
				- Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company's products or services?
			- **Employee satisfaction
				- Is the project likely to improve company morale, reducing turnover?
			- **Employee productivity**
				- Will the project reduce employee's overtime hours, saving the company money?
			- **Brand perception**
				- Is the project likely to improve the company's brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?
	- **Calculating Costs and Benefits**
		- **ROI (Return on Investment) Formula**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230120143138.png]]
			- **G**: Financial gains expected
			- **C**: Upfront and ongoing costs of investment
			- Example
				- Project costs $6000 upfront
				- $25/month for 12 months (i.e. $300/year)
				- $10,000 revenue over the course of the year
				- $$\frac{($10,000-$6,300)}{$6300}=0.58=58\% $$
