- **How to introduce new tools**
	- **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible** 
		- Make sure it isn't a surprise
		- Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible
		- Will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool
	- **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders** 
		- Could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. 
		- You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority.
		- The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps
	- **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool** 
		- You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. 
		- It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. 
		- You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. 
		- This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. 
		- This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.
	- **Ensure the tool is fully functional** **before** **the team is introduced to it.** 
		- Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. 
		- Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. 
		- Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn’t live up to how it is supposed to function. 
		- This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!
	- **Set up training for the tool as needed** **before** **you ask the team to actually use it.** 
		- Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. 
		- It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members’ needs are addressed. 
		- Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.
