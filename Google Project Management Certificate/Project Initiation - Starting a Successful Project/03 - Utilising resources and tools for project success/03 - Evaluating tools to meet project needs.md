		- Can help track detailed information about all kinds of tasks and make it easy to communicate with lots of different people
		- Effective communication and tracking are large parts of day-to-day tasks
		- **Office Green**
			- Tons of information to provide
			- Instead of using a whiteboard (whereby everyone has to go by your desk), use something like a Google Doc
				- Store the information on an online resource as it allows for quicker accessibility, and for it to be updated in real time
		- Information can go both ways
			- Where team mates can communicate with you, as much as you do with them
			- Avoids the need for extra meetings and phone calls
		- **Tools help you**
			- **Track task deadlines**
				- Is it on time, or delayed?
				- Lets you quickly see what any changes will do to the project
			- **Provide visibility for everyone, including stakeholders**
				- *Examples*
					- monday.com
					- g suite
					- Jira
					- Smartsheet
			- **Manage a budget**
			- **Create helpful diagrams**
			- **Manage contracts**
		- **Simple vs Sophisticated**
			- **Simple**
				- Things such as a google doc
				- Easy to use, and intuitive
				- Limited capability
				- Good for smaller projects
			- **Sophisticated**
				- Things like a scheduling software
				- Good for larger projects, and a larger scope
				- Takes some time for everyone to get used to the software, and this should be accounted for

## Introducing new tools to a team
![[Pasted image 20230212141417.png]]
- **How to introduce new tools**
	- **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible** 
		- Make sure it isn't a surprise
		- Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible
		- Will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool
	- **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders** 
		- Could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. 
		- You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority.
		- The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps
	- **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool** 
		- You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. 
		- It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. 
		- You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. 
		- This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. 
		- This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.
	- **Ensure the tool is fully functional** **before** **the team is introduced to it.** 
		- Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. 
		- Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. 
		- Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn’t live up to how it is supposed to function. 
		- This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!
	- **Set up training for the tool as needed** **before** **you ask the team to actually use it.** 
		- Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. 
		- It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members’ needs are addressed. 
		- Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.

			- *Resources*
				- [Google Sheets cheat sheet - Google Workspace Learning Center](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300022?hl=en)
			- **Create lists**
				- To create any list in Sheets, simply label each list
					- for example, Name, Date, Notes, or other criteria—in the **header row**. 
						- (The header row is the top row in the spreadsheet.) 
				- Add a different list item in each cell underneath the list title. 
				- Most lists are arranged vertically, but you might prefer a horizontal list depending on the types of items.
			- **Display and hide content**
				- **Freeze rows or columns**
					- Freezing the header row (or column for horizontal lists) and formatting headers is a great way to make the list titles stand out.
					- Freezing a header row keeps the row in place when you scroll down the list, so you can always see what the list titles are. 
					- Format the headers just like you would text in a document by changing the font, style, size, or color.
				- **Group and hide related content**
					- Grouping rows and columns allows you to expand and collapse larger categories of data or information with a single click. 
					- This makes your spreadsheet easier to read and manage by hiding the grouped data when it’s not needed, or quickly ungroup and show when it is needed.
