## The Value of project documentation
- **Project Documentation**
	- Although may not be your job to do final decisions, is your job to do all the planning
	- **Project Planning**
		- Identifying project goals and deliverables
		- Choosing the right people to add to the team
	- Too much for someone to keep track off
	- Important for anyone that is affected by any decisions to be well informed
	- Documentation is such an important part of a project role
	- Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear communication
	- Helps set the stage for the project
	- **Goals of documentation**
		- What problem are you trying to solve?
		- What are the project goals?
		- What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project's stakeholders?
		- What resources does the team need to complete their work?
	- Helps preserve decisions made early on in the project
		- Reference later for those that join later on
	- Documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks, timelines or costs you hadn't previously considered
	- Provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the end of the project
