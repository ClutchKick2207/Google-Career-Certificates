## Why is Project initiation essential?
> [!info] Cost Benefit Analysis - Definition
> The process of adding up the expected value of a project - the benefits - and comparing them to the dollar costs

- **Project Initiation**
	- First step of the project
	- Well planned initiation allows for a strong foundation for the rest of the project
	- Often initiated to combat a specific issue from a business
	- Identify project goals, resources, etc.
		- During initial discussions with stakeholders
			- Ask the right questions
			- Determine criteria for project success with stakeholders
			- Identify project research
			- Do research
			- Determine resources
			- Clearly document
	- Identify the boundaries of the project
	- **If not initiated properly**
		- Without understanding project goals, may underestimate the resources needed/time needed
		- May not accomplish appropriate goals
		- Gain as much clarity during the initial phase, as it'll allow for saving time throughout the rest of the project
	- **Cost Benefit Analysis**
		- Work with stakeholders
			- **Benefits**
				- What value will this project create?
				- How much money could this project save our organisation?
				- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
				- How much time will be saved?
				- How will the user experience be improved?
			- **Costs**
				- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
				- What will be the one-time costs?
				- Are there any on-going costs?
				- What about long-term costs?
		- Benefits should always outweigh the costs of the project

## Key components of project initiation
> [!info] Project Charter - Definition
> A document that clearly defines the project and its goals, and outlines what is needed to accomplish them
- **Project initiation parts**
	- **Goals**
		- The goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve.
		- Have to have clear goals
			- Determined by senior company leaders
	- **Scope**
		- Process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project
	- **Deliverables**
		- Products and services that you will create for your customer, client, or project sponsor
		- Project features and services
		- Documentation
		- i.e. anything that enables the goal of the project to be achieved
		- Can be tangible (Chapters of a textbook) and intangible (Software, scheduling systems)
	- **Success Criteria**
		- Standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching it's goals
	- **Stakeholders**
		- The people who both have an interest in, and are affected by, the completion and success of a project
		- Instrumental in the above steps
		- Often create the guidelines and authorise the project to happen in the first place
		- Understand the expectations early
		- Make sure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project
	- **Resources**
		- Budget
		- People
		- Materials
		- Other items you will have at your disposal
		- Think carefully about what resources you need initially
- **Project Charter**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230119182411.png]]
	- Contains all the details of a project
	- Review the document with stakeholders to make sure you haven't missed anything

## Performing a cost-benefit analysis
- **Cost-benefit analysis**
	- **Benefits of a cost-benefit analysis**
		- Minimise risks
		- Maximise gains
		- Allows for clear communication with stakeholders
		- Uses objective data, and therefore can point out any biases, and keep out stakeholder self-interest
		- Reduces waste
		- Provides good justification for a project
	- **Guiding Questions**
		- **Benefits**
			- What value will this project create?
			- How much money could this project save our organisation?
			- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
			- How much time will it save?
			- How will it improve the customer experience?
		- **Costs**
			- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
			- What are the one-time costs?
			- Are there any ongoing costs?
			- What about the long term costs?
		- **Intangible Benefits** (Costs are the same but reversed)
			- **Customer Satisfaction**
				- Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company's products or services?
			- **Employee satisfaction
				- Is the project likely to improve company morale, reducing turnover?
			- **Employee productivity**
				- Will the project reduce employee's overtime hours, saving the company money?
			- **Brand perception**
				- Is the project likely to improve the company's brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?
	- **Calculating Costs and Benefits**
		- **ROI (Return on Investment) Formula**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230120143138.png]]
			- **G**: Financial gains expected
			- **C**: Upfront and ongoing costs of investment
			- Example
				- Project costs $6000 upfront
				- $25/month for 12 months (i.e. $300/year)
				- $10,000 revenue over the course of the year
				- $$\frac{($10,000-$6,300)}{$6300}=0.58=58\% $$

		- Commercial landscaping company
			- Specialises in plant décor for offices and other businesses
		- Director of Product has an idea for a new service
			- *Plant Pals*
				- High volume customers are offered small, low maintenance plants for their desks
				- As the project manager, are responsible for the rollout of this new service

## Determining project goals and deliverables
> [!info] Project Goal - Definition
> The desired outcome of the project
- **Project goals and deliverables**

		- Example
			- Improve customer response times for inquiries via email by 20%
		- **Officegreen example**
			- Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year
			- Through the introduction of "plant pals"
				- Desk plants for top customers
			- "Increase revenues through a new services offering by 5%"
		- Allows for a roadmap to your destination
		- **Good vs Bad goal**
			- How well it is defined
			- "How clear and specific is the goal?"
				- If the goal is the destination, are you confident that you'll know if you've even arrived?
			- Generally make it something clear (such as a numerical increase, and something that isn't vague)
			- Also says how to do, what you have been asked to do
				- "via email"
				- "via a new service offering"
				- And then by how much
					- 5%
					- 20%
	- **Stakeholders**
		- Get information from stakeholders
		- Ask how it aligns to the company's larger goals and mission
		- Example
			- Finished a new product feature
			- Stated goal was to deliver an early version of this feature and collect user feedback
			- When it was delivered for feedback, no one way available
			- Therefore had to discuss if you have met the goal if there is no user feedback
				- Some think that you have achieved the goal
				- Some think that you have not
			- Customer was satisfied, and therefore should've been completed
				- But internal team wasted time going back and forth about it
			- Make sure to keep everyone (stakeholders and team), in the loop about the project goals
	- **Project Deliverables**
		- The products or services that are created for the customer, client or project sponsor
		- What get produced or presented at the end of a task, event, or process

			- Look at last year's revenue in order to see what you should aim for this year
	- **Attainable**
		- Is it possible?
		- **Questions**
			- Can it reasonably be reached?
				- A little challenging to encourage growth
				- Don't want it to be too extreme, otherwise you can never reach it

		- Use a rubric to grade
			- Checklist of items, each with a mark allocation
			- Score at least 80% to pass
				- If a Rubric has 10 points, need at least 8
			- Rubric is available before the assignment is submitted, so you are able to see how you will be graded
			- Give and receive qualitative feedback
		- Feedback
			- Positive and Negative feedback
			- Leave thoughtful and constructive feedback

## Optional: What to know about peer-graded feedback
- **Peer Graded Assignments**
	- **Submitting Work**
		- Generally involve submitting documents or spreadsheets for review
		- Can submit as a URL (a shared Google Doc for example), or a downloadable file (such as .docx or .pdf)
		- To grade your assignment, graders will access the link, or download the file submitted
		- Try submitting it a day or two before the deadline, to allow for timely feedback

## Introduction to OKRs
- **OKRs**
	- "**O**bjectives + **K**ey **R**esults"
	- Combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome
	- Clearly state goal, and provide specific details to measure success
	- Separate different components of SMART goals, and clarify them even further
	- Can be used to create "stretch goals"
		- Challenges to achieve

## Creating OKRs for your project
- **OKRs**
	- **What are OKRs?**
		- Objectives and Key Result
		- ![[Pasted image 20230129140328.png]]
		- Combines a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome
		- Company-wide OKRs are used to set an ultimate goal for an entire organisation
		- Team, department and project-level OKRs describe focused results each group needs to do in order to support the organisation
	- **OKRs and Project Management**
		- Can help in expanding upon project goals and further clarify the deliveries you'll need from the project to accomplish the goals
		- Allows for an appropriate scope for a team (in a project-level OKR), therefore allowing for you to say "no" to requests that may get in the way
		- Can create and push project-level OKRs to help motivate the team, as they are used to push past what is easily achievable
	- **Creating OKRs**
		- **Set your objectives**
			- Project objectives should be aspirational, aligned with organisational goals, action-oriented, concrete and significant
			- Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project, and determine what you want the project team to do
			- **Examples**
				- Build the most secure data security software
				- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions
				- Provide a top-performing service
				- Make a universally-available app
				- Increase market reach
				- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region
			- **Strong Objectives Criteria**
				- Aspirational
				- Aligned with organizational goals
				- Action-oriented
				- Concrete
				- Significant
			- **Questions to ask to create an Objective**
				- Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals?
				- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?
				- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
				- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?
		- **Develop key results**
			- Add 2-3 key results for each objective
			- Should be time-bound
			- Can be used to indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period
			- Or to define whether you have met your objective at the end of the project
			- Should be challenging
			- **Examples**
				- X% new signups within first quarter post launch
				- Increase advertiser spend by X%
				- New feature adoption is at least X% 
				- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported by customers per Sprint
				- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X%
			- **Strong Key Results Criteria**
				- Results-oriented—**not** a task
				- Measurable and verifiable
				- Specific and time-bound
				- Aggressive yet realistic
			- **Questions to ask to create a Key Result**
				- What does success mean?
				- What metrics would prove that we've successfully achieved the objective?
	- **OKR Development best practices**
		- Think of objectives as motivational and inspiring
		- Think of key results as tactical and specific
		- Objective describes what you want to do, and key results describe how you'll know you did it
		- Develop 2-3 key results for each objective
		- Document OKRs and link them into the project plan

## Using OKRs to evaluate progress
![[Pasted image 20230203090222.png]]
- **OKRs**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230203090229.png]]
- **Communicating and tracking OKRs**
	- **Share OKRs**
		- Once you have created OKRs, it is important to communicate them to the team so that everyone knows what to do

		- Traffic light scale
			- Red: no progress
			- Yellow: some progress
			- Green: completed objective
		- Yes/No methods
			- yes: achieved objective
			- no: didn't achieve objective
		- Scale
			- example
				- "launch 6 features"
				- Only launched 3
				- Therefore score of 0.5
			- Score ranges from 0.0 - 1.0
	- **Set scoring expectations**
		- Expectations can be set from 0.6-0.7 (60-70% completed) across all OKRs
		- Lower scores may indicate that the OKRs are too ambitious
		- Higher scores may indicate that it is not challenging enough
	- **Schedule checkpoints**
		- Regularly communicate the status of project OKRs with the team and senior managers
		- A monthly check-up can help, and make sure that goals and objectives have not changed
## Defining project scope
- **Project Scope**
	- Boundaries of a project
	- Agreed upon understanding on what is included and excluded from the project
	- Who the project is delivered to
	- Who is using the project
	- The project's complexibility
		- Complex or straightforward?
	- Project timeline
	- Budget
	- Resources
	- **Office Green**
		- **Plant Pals**
			- Small low maintenance plants such as cacti and ferns
			- Can order online or on a catalogue
			- Will be shipped to them
		- **Scope**
			- Will you provide replacement plants
			- Who will it be offered
			- Catalogue physical, website?
			- How will they order?
			- Dimensions of the catalogue
			- Black and white
			- etc.
	- Speak with sponsors and stakeholders, to see what they want
	- Also learn what is not included in the project
	- **Questions**
		- Where did the project come from?
		- Why is it needed?
		- What is the project expected to achieve?
		- What does the project sponsor have in mind?
		- Who approves the final results?

## Gathering information to define scope
- Defining scope
	- **Ask scope defining questions**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230129214957.png]]

## Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope
> [!info] In-scope - Definition
> Tasks that are included in the project plan and contribute to the project's goal

> [!info] Out-of-scope - Definition
> Tasks that are not included in the project plan and don't contribute to the project's goal

> [!info] Scope creep - Definition
> Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project's scope at any point after the project begins

- **Project scope**
	- Point out when things take too much time and too much money
	- Try to avoid scope creep
		- Although it is good to avoid, if it is something small, and can provide a lot of value, can be worth it
		- Sometimes unavoidable, especially when coming from stakeholders and sponsors
		- Although good to be firm, as it can go against the budget and resources
	- **Sources**
		- **External**
			- Customer request
			- Environment shifts
			- Tech changes
			- **Solutions**
				- Stakeholders have visibility into the project
				- Know what is being produced, timeline, costs, etc
				- Get clarity on project requirements
				- Set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement
				- Create a plan for dealing with out-of-scope requests
				- Put your agreements and plans in writing
		- **Internal**
			- Product improvements
			- Process changes
			- Anytime a team member takes on an extra task, losing time and resources
			- Maintain limits, and keep everything just at the scope
			- Protect it at all costs

## Strategies for controlling scope creep
- **Best practices**
	- **Define your project’s requirements.** 
		- Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 
	- **Set a clear project schedule.** 
		- Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.
	- **Determine what is out of scope.** 
		- Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 
	- **Provide** **alternatives.** 
		- Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.
	- **Set up a change control process.** 
		- During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
	- **Learn how to say no.** 
		- Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 
	- **Collect** **costs for out-of-scope work.** 
		- If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.

## Managing changes to a project's scope
- **Project Scope**
	- Deliver within the project's scope agreements
	- Within the given deadline, and approved budget
	- May need to make compromises, and weigh up trade offs, as situations arise
	- Every time a team member is doing something else apart from the task, more than just time is lost
	- **Triple constraint model**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230129221403.png]]
		- Three most significant restrictions of any project
		- **Time**
			- Timeline
			- Schedule
			- Deadlines
		- **Cost**
			- Budget
			- Resources
			- People that will work on it
		- **Scope**
			- The limitations of the project's boundaries
		- A change in any of the three has an affect on the other
			- A decrease in budget affects the time and scope
		- Look at what you are willing to trade off
			- Such as if there is a specific deadline that must be met, need to limit any changes to the scope
			- Must look or function a certain way
				- Scope is a priority, justify changes in time or cost
		- Just because you can make a change doesn't mean you should make a change
		- You are able to ask stakeholders and project sponsors
		- **Office Green**
			- Wants to have a pot that will tell you when to water it
			- ![[Pasted image 20230129221837.png]]
			- Can extend the timeline to compensate
			- A request has been made to reduce budget, without changing scope
				- ![[Pasted image 20230129221926.png]]
			- Finish early
				- ![[Pasted image 20230129221939.png]]

## Introduction: Working effectively with stakeholders
> [!info] Stakeholders - Definition
> People who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success
- **RACI charts**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230204203350.png]]

## Accessibility for project managers
> [!info] Accessibility - Definition
> Actively removing any barriers that might prevent persons with disabilities from being able to access technology, information, or experiences, and levelling the playing field so everyone has an equal chance of enjoying life and being successful
- **Accessibility**
	- Should be at any role of a company
	- Over 1 billion people have a disability
	- Diverse and intersectional
		- Could be born with, or developed later on
	- Could be permanent, to temporary, or situational
		- Deaf, broken leg, using a remote in the dark (respectively)
	- Communicate freely
		- Make sure to ask, and have other people comfortable to ask what they need
		- Try and deliver where you can
	- As a project manager, you are responsible for making sure a group of people can come together to achieve a common goal using shared tools and systems
	- Make sure the infrastructure and culture works for everyone

## Choosing a project team
- **Project Team**
	- Consider and outline needs
	- Choosing the right people for the team is a big task
	- The people that do the actual work on the project
	- **Key Questions**
		- How many people do I need on my team each step of the way?
		- Which team members do I need and when?
		- Are those experts already busy on other projects?
		- Who makes the final decisions on project resources?
	- **Consider**
		- **Required roles**
			- Accountable for specific tasks in the project life cycle
			- Home Construction Project Team
				- Includes roles such as
					- Architect
					- Site manager
					- Construction workers
		- **Team size**
			- Small projects, may only need 3-4 people to complete the project in time
				- Might not be enough people to finish the deliverables on time
			- Large projects may need dozens
				- Communication can become difficult
				- Someone can miss important details
		- **Necessary Skills**
			- To see who should do what
			- Remember that skills can be taught
				- Just because someone doesn't have the skills initially, it doesn't mean they wouldn't be a good fit for the team
				- Could bring a positive attitude, and attention to detail
				- Make sure they are trained in time so they don't cause any project delays
		- **Availability**
			- Maybe staffed on a different project
			- Make sure that it is relevant for the staff member
				- Such as giving them the visibility needed for a promotion
		- **Motivation**
			- Key ingredient to great work
			- Pick people who are excited to get to work
	- **Office Green**
		- Ask about staff experience
		- Availability
		- Workspace
		- Team member workload on other projects
		- **Questions to ask**
			- Who on the team has office landscaping experience?
			- Who is local to the city where the launch will happen?
			- Who will be fully dedicated to the project for the next 8 weeks?
		- No exact formula
			- Makes it tricky
		- Look deeper into each part of the project

## Review: The building blocks of a project dream team
![[Pasted image 20230205130207.png]]
- **Project Dream team**
	- **Too big, too small, or just right?**
		- Dependant on the size of the project
		- Complex projects with large divisions of work will require larger project teams
		- Simple projects with straightforward expectations may only require a few people on the project team
	- **The right skills and abilities to fill the role**
		- Multiple roles may be assigned to one person
			- Especially in a smaller team
		- May require those with necessary technical skills
			- Specific skills for the task being performed
			- *Office Green*
				- Indoor landscaping design for the layout of plants
				- Floral design of plant arranging
		- Interpersonal skills are also highly valuable
			- People skills/soft skills
		- **Problem Solving skills**
			- Being able to solve problems in a large complex project is vital
			- Need to use their own judgement to get the job done
		- **Leadership skills**
			- Help team members navigate organisational boundaries and effectively communicate with stakeholders to generate buy-in
	- **Who is available?**
		- Especially true in Matrix organisations
			- Team members being able to have multiple bosses
		- May not be able to keep a team member for the entire project
		- May not be able to pick the team members you want to for your project
		- May have to use team members picked by the project sponsor
		- Have a diverse team
			- Allows for different viewpoints
			- and different lines of thinking
		- Dedicate time early on in the team to develop trust between the team members
	- **What motivates them?**
		- Make sure to take note of the motivation level of team members, and engage them to keep them motivated
		- Keep the team engaged and keep them ready to overcome any obstacles that may occur
		- Maintaining a positive outlook with the team can keep them motivated

## Defining project roles

				- Instant messaging platform
				- Purchased by company ABC
					- They are the customer
				- Users are everyone within corporation ABC that will be using the software
		- **Stakeholders**
			-  Anyone involved in the project who has a vested interest in the project's success
			- **Primary**

## Project Role Responsibilities
- ![[Pasted image 20230205134826.png]]

## Completing a stakeholder analysis
> [!info] Stakeholder buy-in - Definition
> The process of involving these people in decision making to hopefully reach a broader consensus  on the organisation's future
- **Stakeholder Analysis**
	- **Primary Stakeholders**
		- People who will benefit directly from the project's success
	- **Secondary Stakeholders**
		- People who are indirectly impacted by the project's success
	- Helps you see all the opportunities for success, and the risks
	- Allows for you to see which stakeholders are taking on which responsibilites
	- Helps include the right people in the important conversations
	- *3 key steps*
		- Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
		- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
			- **Influence**
				- Measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much this stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome
			- **Interest**
				- How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes?
		- Assess stakeholder's ability to participate and then find ways to involve them
	- **Power Grid**
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205150811.png]]
		- 2x2 grid
		- Assign each stakeholder's level of importance to the project
			- Measuring their influence and interest
		- The higher their level of influence and interest, the more important
			- Without their support, will probably not be successful
			- **Key stakeholders**
				- Closely partner with them
		- Everyone gets a spot in the grid
		- Look above at the diagram, and treat as listed
		- **Template**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205150853.png]]
		- Different ways to involve stakeholders
			- Meet with some stakeholders every day
			- Some just periodic emails with updates
		- **Stakeholder buy-in**
			- Pay particular attention to high impact stakeholders
				- Keep them in the loop
				- Explain to them how this project will help them achieve their goals
				- Have their support later on when any issues come up
		- **Communicating with stakeholders**
			- If you have 1 main stakeholder
				- Likely to be highly important and influential
				- Needs constant communication
			- If you have numerous stakeholders
				- Not as involved in the day-to-day tasks
			- Overcommunicate early on so stakeholders can make decisions with as much information as possible
			- Send daily end of day progress emails
			- Think about the amount of project detail every stakeholder needs
			- Daily, weekly, monthly check-ins

## Prioritising stakeholders and generating their buy-in
- **Conducting a stakeholder analysis**
	- **Key Steps**
		1.  **Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts.** 
			- *Questions to ask* 
				- Who is invested in the project? 
				- Who is impacted by this project? 
				- Who contributes to this project? 
		2. **Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder**
			- Determine who your key stakeholders are. 
			- The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 
		3. **Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them.** 
			- **Active Stakeholders**
				- More opinions and touchpoints
			- **Passive Stakeholders**
				- Preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day
			- Just because some stakeholders don't participate as directly, doesn't mean they aren't important
			- Many different factors that can influence the stakeholder's ability to participate
				- Physical distance from the project
				- Existing workload
	- **Steering committee**
		- A collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project
		- Can influence multiple departments within an organisation
			- Potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager
	- **Visualising Analysis**
		- **Power grid**
			- ![[Pasted image 20230205154232.png]]
			- Shows stakeholder interest in the project versus their influence over the project
			- Allows for evaluating how to manage their stakeholders
			- Used to determine the appropriate level of engagement required by the project team to gain the stakeholder's buy-in and trust
			- Make sure to take into account each individual project, as they all will be different
	- **Generating stakeholder buy-in**
		- Make decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require
		- **Tips**
			- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder
			- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team
			- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate
	- **Optional Reading**
		- [We Asked the Project Management Community: What Steps Do You Take To Identify and Prioritize All Stakeholders at the Start of a Project? (pmi.org)](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/identify-prioritize-stakeholders-11408)

## Stakeholder Interviews
- **Suggested Questions**
	- What are your most important priorities/goals?
	-   How will this initiative/project support you and your most important priorities?
	-   What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?
	-   Here’s how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?
	-   What can I clarify for you?
	-   What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?
	-   What would success look like for you?
	-   Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative?
	-   What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
	-   Where do you see me getting support for this initiative? Facing resistance?
	-   What additional thoughts/questions do you have?

## Elements of a RACI chart
> [!info] RACI Chart - Definition
> Helps define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently
- **RACI chart**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230205213736.png]]
	- **RACI Chart principles**
		- **Responsible**
			- Those doing the work to complete the task
		- **Accountable**
			- Those making sure the work gets done
		- **Consulted**
			- Those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision makers
		- **Informed**
			- Those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete
	- **Role confusion**
		- *Unbalanced workloads*
			- Some people might be doing more or less work compared to other people on the team
		- *Unclear hierarchy*
			- People aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done
		- *Unclear ownership decisions*
			- Unsure who makes the final call on a project
		- *Overlapping work*
			- Multiple people are responsible for the same work
		- *Excessive communication*
			- Too much can make things more complicated
			- Cause information overload
				- Not too sure what to pay attention to
		- RACI can help resolve/avoid all this

## Building out a RACI chart
- **RACI Chart**
	- **Elements of a RACI chart**
		- **Responsible**
			- *Who gets the work done*
			- Those who are actually doing the work to complete the task
			- At least one is needed
			- Try and limit the amount of people you have assigned to "responsible"
				- Although you may need more than one
			- *Questions*
				- What department does the work fall under?
				- Who will perform the work?
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Task is to develop price points
				- Therefore will list Financial Analyst
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205215505.png]]
		- **Accountable**
			- *Who makes sure the work is done*
			- Only have one individual accountable for each task
			- Helps clarify ownership for the task
			- Ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable to the responsible party
			- *Questions*
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
				- Who will delegate the task to be completed?
			- May encounter a situation where the responsible party is accountable
				- Try and avoid this where possible to avoid confusion of ownership
			- *Office Green Example*
				- Head of finance will be assigned here
				- Has to make sure the project stays on budget and creates a profit anyways, so needs to approve the Financial Analyst's work
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205215751.png]]
		- **Consulted**
			- *Who gives input or feedback on work*
			- Have useful information to help complete the task
			- No maximum or minimum amount of people that can be here
			- Important that each person has a reason for being there
			- *Questions*
				- Who will the task impact?
				- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
				- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
			- Consulted people will be in frequent, two-way communication with the responsible party
				- Make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the goal efficiently and correctly
			- *Office Green example*
				- Have the director of product be consulted
				- As they oversee all product offerings
					- Have knowledge about the product, and any potential changes, and how this can affect price points
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205220213.png]]
		- **Informed**
			- *Who needs to know the outcome*
			- Just need to know the final decisions, and when the item is completed
			- Common to have many people assigned to this role
			- Will not be asked for feedback
				- so make sure that anyone here only requires status updates and does not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the task
			- As a lot of people may be in this section, make sure it is not labour intensive to get  the information out
				- Something as simple as a read only version of the planning document is good
			- *Questions*
				- Who cares about this task’s completion?
				- Who will be affected by the outcome?
			- *Office Green*
				- Let the sales team know what has been happening, and also keep them informed on any progress
				- ![[Pasted image 20230205220509.png]]
	- **RACI chart example**
		- One a bit above is an example
		- Here is another one
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205215156.png]]

## Getting the most out of a RACI chart
- **RACI charts**
	- **Definition and Structure**
		- Determining the graph allows for you to keep in control of the project
		- ![[Pasted image 20230205224851.png]]
	- **Workload balance**
		- Try not to assign too many tasks to one stakeholder
		- Good idea to go back and track how many "R"s are assigned to each stakeholder
		- Helps you avoid overloading a single member in the team
		- A RACI chart can help mitigate single points of failure (aka *Silos*, where knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on a single person)
			- Therefore distribute tasks to avoid burnout
		- Try not to rely just on top performers to keep the project moving forward
			- If you find yourself doing so, step back and revaluate your team
	- **Put your RACI into practice**
		- Share RACI with sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and it signed off
		- When you get stakeholder buy-in, can set clear expectations for the team, and make sure everyone is aligned with their responsibilities
		- Document your team and stakeholder's acknowledgement of expectations through the project charter, meeting notes and in the RACI
		- Makes sure to continually check in with stakeholders and your team
	- **When should you use a RACI chart?**
		- Use it for larger, more complex projects
		- Might just slow down smaller projects
		- Projects which have a large amount of stakeholders would benefit
		- Even if you don't use it, it allows for a much larger level of understanding
			- Can help for a better project management experience

## Why Projects fail: Initiation missteps
- **Projects failing: Initiation Mistakes**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230205232303.png]]
	- **Unclear expectations**
		- *Questions*
			- What is the end goal?
			- What are the expected deliverables and schedule?
			- What is the budget?
			- Who are the stakeholders?
		- Not taking the time at the beginning of the project to answer these questions can bring headaches down the line
	- **Unrealistic expectations**
		- Although good to impress managers, try not to be too unreasonable from the start
		- Give yourself enough time and resources to complete the task comfortably
		- Understand the requirements before agreeing to any deadline
		- Best practice is to not commit to any firm deadlines while initiating to avoid setting any unrealistic expectations
		- Will have more information and will be able to better manage expectations in the planning phase
	- **Miscommunication**
		- Clear communication is key
		- Make sure it is communicated in a timely manner
		- Make sure it includes pertinent information
			- Risks
			- Decisions made
			- Scope changes
		- Make sure it is sent to the correct stakeholders
		- Conduct a stakeholder analysis, and use a RACI chart
		- Don't have to cater to everyone, but have to set clear expectations about how communication will occur
		- Make sure to take some time to understand the communication needs of the team and stakeholders
		- Set expectations for communications early on, so that everyone can have a clear understanding of how you will all communicate
	- **Lack of resources**
		- Resources include
			- Team members
			- Budget
			- Materials
		- Without proper planning, resources can be over-tasked or depleted
		-  Have to account that staff can be juggling multiple things at the same time, and may not be able to dedicate their entire time to this one project
		- Make sure to accurately calculate project expenses, and have some buffer room where possible
	- **Scope Creep**
		- Make sure that you know exactly what is and what isn't expected from the project's work and deliverables

## Introducing new tools to a team
![[Pasted image 20230212141417.png]]
- **How to introduce new tools**
	- **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible** 
		- Make sure it isn't a surprise
		- Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible
		- Will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool
	- **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders** 
		- Could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. 
		- You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority.
		- The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps
	- **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool** 
		- You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. 
		- It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. 
		- You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. 
		- This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. 
		- This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.
	- **Ensure the tool is fully functional** **before** **the team is introduced to it.** 
		- Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. 
		- Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. 
		- Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn’t live up to how it is supposed to function. 
		- This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!
	- **Set up training for the tool as needed** **before** **you ask the team to actually use it.** 
		- Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. 
		- It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members’ needs are addressed. 
		- Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.
