		- Use *Benchmarks* (points of reference)
			- To make sure you are using accurate metrics
			- Look at last year's revenue in order to see what you should aim for this year
	- **Attainable**
		- Is it possible?
		- **Questions**
			- Can it reasonably be reached?
				- A little challenging to encourage growth
				- Don't want it to be too extreme, otherwise you can never reach it

## Navigating Peer/Self Reviews
- **Peer/Self Reviews**

	- Apply what you learnt to real world Project Management problems, and situations
	- Create the types of artifacts project managers use everyday
	- Finish these hands on activities where you can
		- As it provides practical experience for interviews
		- Allows you to manage projects better in your personal or professional life
	- **Self Review**
		- Follow step-by-step instructions to move the project forward
		- Quizzes with "Activity" in the title
		- When you finish an activity, taken through an Exemplar of the completed activity to compare with own work
		- Review the examplars carefully so you know what you did well, and what to improve for next time
		- Some activities may have multiple right answers
		- Examplars only explain one way of doing things
			- But it gives guides for other approaches
			- Therefore not just the answers, but shows what approaches you can take
	- **Quiz Questions**
		- May be graded or ungraded
		- Measurement of progress
		- Expand knowledge
	- **Peer-Review Assignments**
		- Similar format to Self Review
		- Classmates will grade your assignments, and you will grade theirs.
		- Have to grade at least 2 submissions (can grade more)
		- Gives objective feedback, and allows for you to see how others did a similar problem
		- Use a rubric to grade
			- Checklist of items, each with a mark allocation
			- Score at least 80% to pass
				- If a Rubric has 10 points, need at least 8
			- Rubric is available before the assignment is submitted, so you are able to see how you will be graded
			- Give and receive qualitative feedback
		- Feedback
			- Positive and Negative feedback
			- Leave thoughtful and constructive feedback

## Optional: What to know about peer-graded feedback
- **Peer Graded Assignments**
	- **Submitting Work**
		- Generally involve submitting documents or spreadsheets for review
		- Can submit as a URL (a shared Google Doc for example), or a downloadable file (such as .docx or .pdf)
		- To grade your assignment, graders will access the link, or download the file submitted
		- Try submitting it a day or two before the deadline, to allow for timely feedback

	- Analyse a scenario to identify project goals
	- Write goals using SMART criteria
- **Scenario**
	- *Background*
		- Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.
	- *Main Goal*

		- Office Green’s *customer retention rate was 80% last year*, but the CEO wants that number to *increase by at least 10% this year*.
		- Last year, *70% of customers who left Office Green* for competitors said they did so because they *wanted more extensive services*. When surveyed, *85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals*.
		- The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a *customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year*—a slight increase over last year. *The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years*.
		- The company plans to *create an Operations and Training plan* for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.
		- Office Green will promote the new service with a *new marketing and sales strategy*, a *redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page*, and a *print catalog*. 
		- With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their *customer base will grow by at least 15%*.
		- Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from *15K to 13K visits each month*. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to *increase by at least 2K each month by the end of the year*, which is *in line with the results of prior marketing campaigns*.
		- *The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter*. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and *assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter*. *(It is currently the start of Q1.)*
