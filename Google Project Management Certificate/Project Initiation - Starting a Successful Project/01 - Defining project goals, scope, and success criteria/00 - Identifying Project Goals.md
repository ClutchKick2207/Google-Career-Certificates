	- **Quiz Questions**
		- May be graded or ungraded
		- Measurement of progress
		- Expand knowledge
	- **Peer-Review Assignments**
		- Similar format to Self Review

		- Gives objective feedback, and allows for you to see how others did a similar problem
		- Use a rubric to grade
			- Checklist of items, each with a mark allocation
			- Score at least 80% to pass
				- If a Rubric has 10 points, need at least 8
			- Rubric is available before the assignment is submitted, so you are able to see how you will be graded

		- Feedback
			- Positive and Negative feedback
			- Leave thoughtful and constructive feedback

## Optional: What to know about peer-graded feedback
- **Peer Graded Assignments**
	- **Submitting Work**
		- Generally involve submitting documents or spreadsheets for review
