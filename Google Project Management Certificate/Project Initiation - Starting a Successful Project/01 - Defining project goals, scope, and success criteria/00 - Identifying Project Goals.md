		- Example
			- Improve customer response times for inquiries via email by 20%
		- **Officegreen example**
			- Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year
			- Through the introduction of "plant pals"
				- Desk plants for top customers
			- "Increase revenues through a new services offering by 5%"
		- Allows for a roadmap to your destination
		- **Good vs Bad goal**
			- How well it is defined
			- "How clear and specific is the goal?"
				- If the goal is the destination, are you confident that you'll know if you've even arrived?

	- **Stakeholders**
		- Get information from stakeholders
		- Ask how it aligns to the company's larger goals and mission
		- Example
			- Finished a new product feature
			- Stated goal was to deliver an early version of this feature and collect user feedback
			- When it was delivered for feedback, no one way available
			- Therefore had to discuss if you have met the goal if there is no user feedback
				- Some think that you have achieved the goal
				- Some think that you have not

				- But internal team wasted time going back and forth about it
