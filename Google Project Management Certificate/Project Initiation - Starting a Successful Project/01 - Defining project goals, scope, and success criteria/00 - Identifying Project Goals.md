## Determining project goals and deliverables
> [!info] Project Goal - Definition
> The desired outcome of the project
- **Project goals and deliverables**
	- **Project Goal**
		- What you have been asked to do, and what you are trying to achieve
		- Example
			- Improve customer response times for inquiries via email by 20%
		- **Officegreen example**
			- Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year
			- Through the introduction of "plant pals"
				- Desk plants for top customers
			- "Increase revenues through a new services offering by 5%"
		- Allows for a roadmap to your destination
		- **Good vs Bad goal**
			- How well it is defined
			- "How clear and specific is the goal?"
				- If the goal is the destination, are you confident that you'll know if you've even arrived?
			- Generally make it something clear (such as a numerical increase, and something that isn't vague)
			- Also says how to do, what you have been asked to do
				- "via email"
				- "via a new service offering"
				- And then by how much
					- 5%
					- 20%
	- **Stakeholders**
		- Get information from stakeholders
		- Ask how it aligns to the company's larger goals and mission
		- Example
			- Finished a new product feature
			- Stated goal was to deliver an early version of this feature and collect user feedback
			- When it was delivered for feedback, no one way available
			- Therefore had to discuss if you have met the goal if there is no user feedback
				- Some think that you have achieved the goal
				- Some think that you have not
			- Customer was satisfied, and therefore should've been completed
				- But internal team wasted time going back and forth about it
			- Make sure to keep everyone (stakeholders and team), in the loop about the project goals
