> Tasks that are not included in the project plan and don't contribute to the project's goal

> [!info] Scope creep - Definition
> Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project's scope at any point after the project begins

- **Project scope**
	- Point out when things take too much time and too much money
	- Try to avoid scope creep
		- Although it is good to avoid, if it is something small, and can provide a lot of value, can be worth it
		- Sometimes unavoidable, especially when coming from stakeholders and sponsors
		- Although good to be firm, as it can go against the budget and resources
	- **Sources**
		- **External**
			- Customer request
			- Environment shifts
			- Tech changes
			- **Solutions**
				- Stakeholders have visibility into the project
				- Know what is being produced, timeline, costs, etc
				- Get clarity on project requirements
				- Set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement
				- Create a plan for dealing with out-of-scope requests
				- Put your agreements and plans in writing
		- **Internal**
			- Product improvements
			- Process changes
			- Anytime a team member takes on an extra task, losing time and resources
			- Maintain limits, and keep everything just at the scope
			- Protect it at all costs

## Strategies for controlling scope creep
- **Best practices**
	- **Define your project’s requirements.** 
		- Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 
	- **Set a clear project schedule.** 
		- Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.
	- **Determine what is out of scope.** 
		- Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 
	- **Provide** **alternatives.** 
		- Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.
	- **Set up a change control process.** 
		- During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
	- **Learn how to say no.** 
		- Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 
	- **Collect** **costs for out-of-scope work.** 
		- If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.
