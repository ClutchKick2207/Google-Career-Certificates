		- According to a recent market assessment, the region’s population is expected to double in the next five years. 
		- Job growth is expected to increase by 48%. 
		- This growth will impact street networks, parking and mobility.
		- Wonder City has several city-wide objectives related to reducing traffic congestion and improving the city’s infrastructure.

		- The project needs to be completed within two years.
		- Community member buy-in and support for the locations of the new bus lines will be required.
		- The project must adhere to all government regulations.

		- The plan includes a marketing campaign to promote the new lines.
