- **Value of a Project Manager**
	- What do they do?
		- Generally Involves
			- Planning and Organising
			- Managing Tasks
			- Budgeting and Controlling costs
		- ...all so the project can be done in the approved timeframe
	- Adds Value through key areas
		- **Prioritisation**
			- *Project managers add value to their teams and organisations through effective prioritisation of tasks required to complete a project*
			- Communicate with the team and stakeholders in order to make a plan on what to do first and what order
			- Real life example
				- Painting a house
					- Picked out paint, and eager to get started
					- Although tempting, have to do other tasks, such as:
						- Laying out drop-cloths
						- Buying more supplies
						- Tape corners and edges
						- Cover furniture
					- Then you can paint
					- Other decisions such as new face plates for the light switches can come later in the process
						- or be switched out if not needed
					- By doing all of these things before actually painting, you are prioritising the steps of the project, and are able to overall be more efficient and be able to have less mistakes
			- By effectively prioritising tasks, you are able to set up your team (and yourself) for a better project outcome
		- **Delegation**
			- *Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organisations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work*
			- Allows for the project to be much more efficient
			- Real life example
				- Painting multiple rooms can take a long time
					- Therefore enlist a few friends to help
				- People
					- One of the friends has a lot of painting experience
						- ask this person to handle the more challenging aspects of the project
						- such as painting the ceiling, or the detail work
						- Schedule her to paint the moulding before another less experienced friend paints the walls
				- By delegating the tasks to those with appropriate skill, and ordering them appropriately as well, applies strength to the planning of the overall project
		- **Effective Communication**
			- *Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders*
			- Being transparent
				- Being up front with plans and ideas
				- Making information readily available
			- Keep in regular contact with the rest of the team and identifies areas where a team-mate need support
			- Real life example
				- Check in with friends periodically
				- Ask if they have enough paint/supplies to complete their task
					- By checking in regularly, you can see if you need to buy more paint before the can is empty, and no work can be done
				- Reach out to the landlord to let them know the days you will be working on the project
					- although not directly involved, the outcomes will affect their property, therefore important to keep them informed
			- Regular contact with people outside the team
				- company leaders that are invested in the project for example
