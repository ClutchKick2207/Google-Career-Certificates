## Job specializations by industry 

We learned that the data specialist role concentrates on in-depth knowledge of databases. In similar fashion, other specialist roles for data analysts can focus on in-depth knowledge of specific industries. For example, in a job as a business analyst you might wear some different hats than in a more general position as a data analyst. As a business analyst, you would likely collaborate with managers, share your data findings, and maybe explain how a small change in the company’s project management system could save the company 3% each quarter. Although you would still be working with data all the time, you would focus on using the data to improve business operations, efficiencies, or the bottom line.

Other industry-specific specialist positions that you might come across in your data analyst job search include:

- Marketing analyst — analyzes market conditions to assess the potential sales of products and services 
    
- HR/payroll analyst — analyzes payroll data for inefficiencies and errors
    
- Financial analyst — analyzes financial status by collecting, monitoring, and reviewing data
    
- Risk analyst — analyzes financial documents, economic conditions, and client data to help companies determine the level of risk involved in making a particular business decision
    
- Healthcare analyst — analyzes medical data to improve the business aspect of hospitals and medical facilities
