## My Notes
> My notes for this overall course will be laid out by module in the course, and have subheadings in order to differentiate between different topics/videos that are presented in the courses. I'll add in any extra notes/resources that I use where necessary, and hope it will be helpful for anyone looking!

## Data Visualisation
- **Visualisation**
	- Graphical representation of information
	- Exciting part of the job
		- Hard work paid off with something interesting
	- Quarterly reports, and how interesting they can be.
	- Visualisations allow for better explanations quickly
		- Cool graphics to back up analysis.
	- Want to create visualisations that make it easy to understand, and interesting to look at
	- make sure to make stakeholder times worthwhile
		- Makes things much for digestible, and allows for easier usage.

## Planning a data visualisation
- **Data Visualisation**
	- **Steps to plan a data visualisation**
		- **Step 1: Explore the data for patterns**
			- Ask for access to any databases or information that you might need
			- Notice, and jot down any patterns that you may see
			- Do further analysis on the patterns that have been found
		- **Step 2: Plan your visuals**
			- See what the audience is already used to in terms of graphs
				- Such as sales people being used to line graphs
			- Step out each logical step as it's own graph
				- *For example*
					- Show sales numbers over time
					- Connect sales to location
					- Show the relationship between sales and website use
					- Show which customers fuel growth
		- **Step 3: Create your visuals**
			- Create actual visuals
			- Try different visual formats, until you can get what you were looking for
			- Use a mix of different types of graphs for maximum visual interest

	- **Build a data visualisation toolkit**
		- Can use the visualisations tools in your spreadsheet to create simple visualisations such as line and bar charts.
		- Can use more advanced tools such as Tableau that allow you to integrate data into dashboard-style visualisations.
		- Can use a programming language such as R, in tools such as RStudio
		- Your choice of visualization will be driven by a variety of drivers including the size of your data, the process you used for analyzing your data (spreadsheet, or databases/queries, or programming languages).
		- **Spreadsheets**
			- Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets
			- Built in charts and examples allow for creating quick visuals easily
				- Can make bar, and pie graphs easily, and give some more advanced visualisations such as maps, waterfall and funnel diagrams
			- This is quite simple in terms of scope however, so it is important to try out other tools for different outcomes.
		- **Visualisation Software**
			- Tableau
			- Tableau is a popular data visualization tool that lets you pull data from nearly any system and turn it into compelling visuals or actionable insights. 
			- The platform offers built-in visual best practices, which makes analyzing and sharing data fast, easy, and (most importantly) useful. 
			- Tableau works well with a wide variety of data and includes an interactive dashboard that lets you and your stakeholders click to explore the data interactively.

		- **Programming Language**
			- R with RStudio
			- A lot of data analysts work with a programming language called R.
			- Most people who work with R end up also using RStudio, an integrated developer environment (IDE), for their data visualization needs. 
			- As with Tableau, you can create dashboard-style data visualizations using RStudio.
