## My Notes
> My notes for this overall course will be laid out by module in the course, and have subheadings in order to differentiate between different topics/videos that are presented in the courses. I'll add in any extra notes/resources that I use where necessary, and hope it will be helpful for anyone looking!

## Program Surveys
- **Program Surveys**
	- Does not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.
	- Be kept confidential, with your name separated from your data.
	- Not be shared outside of our research team, except where you give permission to share contact information with hiring partners.
	- **Entry Survey**
		- The survey will ask about your experiences leading up to this course and the goals you hope to accomplish. This is critical information for making sure we can meet the needs of learners like you, and can continue offering this program in the future.
	- **Individual course feedback**
		- When you complete the last graded assignment within an individual course, you may be asked to complete a survey that revisits earlier questions and asks what you have learned up to that point in the program. Again, filling out this information is voluntary, but extremely beneficial to the program and future learners.
	- **Certificate completion survey**
		- After you complete the last graded assignment in the final course of the certificate, you will be asked to answer a survey that revisits some earlier questions and asks what you have learned throughout the duration of the program. This survey also asks if you would like to share your contact information with prospective employers. Both filling out the survey and sharing your contact information with prospective employers is completely optional. Again, participating in the survey or sharing your information with future employers will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.
