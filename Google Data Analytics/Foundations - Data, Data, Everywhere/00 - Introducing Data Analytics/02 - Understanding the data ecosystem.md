## My Notes
> My notes for this overall course will be laid out by module in the course, and have subheadings in order to differentiate between different topics/videos that are presented in the courses. I'll add in any extra notes/resources that I use where necessary, and hope it will be helpful for anyone looking!

## What is the data ecosystem?
> [!info] Definition - Ecosystem
> A group of elements that interact with each other

> [!info] Definition - Data Ecosystem
> The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organise, analyse and share data 

> [!info] Definition - The Cloud
> A place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive

> [!info] Definition - Data Science
> Creating new ways of modelling and understanding the unknown by using raw data

> [!info] Definition - Data Analysis
> The collection, transformation, and organisation of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision making

- **The Data Ecosystem**
	- Data lives inside it's own ecosystems
	- **Elements of a Data Ecosystem**
		- Hardware
		- Software
		- Tools
		- People that use them
	- Data can be found in the cloud
		- Instead of storing on network, are able to store on a server outside of the network
	- Tap into a retail store's database
		- Information ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews
		- Can use this information to predict what the customers will purchase in the future
	- Human Resources database
		- Ecosystem filled with information from job websites, stats of the current labour market, employment rates, social media data on prospective employees
		- Can use this information to recruit new workers, and improve employee retention and working rates
	- **Data Science vs Data Analysis**
		- Data Scientists create new questions using data
		- Data Analysts answer questions using data

## Data and gut instinct
- **Data and Gut instinct**
	- *6 steps of Data Analysis*
		- **Ask**
			- Ask questions and defining the problem
		- **Prepare**
			- Prepare Data by collecting and storing the information
		- **Process**
			- Process data by cleaning and checking the information
		- **Analyse**
			- Analyse data to find patterns, relationships and trends
		- **Share**
			- Share data with your audience
		- **Act**
			- Act on the data and use the analysis results
	- **Gut Instinct**
		- An intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation
		- Generally not conscious

		- **Why gut instinct can be a problem**
			- Important to make sure that analysts focus on the data to make sure that they make informed decisions
			- Example
				- Consider an example of a restaurant entrepreneur, partnering with a well known chef to develop a new restaurant in a bustling part of the cityâ€™s central shopping district. The well known chef has several restaurants across the city. Banking on their reputation, the restaurant entrepreneur and chef followed gut instinct and created another uniquely themed restaurant. However, fundraising efforts fell short to fund the opening of the restaurant after months of planning and preparation. The property will go back on the market to be sold at a loss. Had the entrepreneur done more research, they would've found data showing prospective customers in this new restaurant location were very different from the chef's other restaurants.
			- The more you are able to understand about data related to the project, the easier it will be to figure out what is required. These efforts will also help identify errors and gaps in your data so you can communicate your findings more effectively.
	- **Data + business knowledge = mystery solved**
		- Blending data with business knowledge, and a bit of gut instinct will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst.
		- Figuring out the exact mix for each particular particular project.
			- A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis
			- "How do I define success for this project?"
		- **Questions**
			- What kins of results are needed?
			- Who will be informed?
			- Am I answering the question being asked?
			- How quickly does a decision need to be made?
		- If you are working on a rush project, you might need to rely on your own knowledge and experience more than usual.
		- There just isn't enough time to thoroughly analyse all of the available data.
		- If you get a project that involved plenty of time and resources, then it is a good idea to be more data driven to make the best possible choice
		- Very important to find what blend of instinctual and data driven decision to make.

## Origins of the data analysis process

			- Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
		- **Process**
			- Data cleaning/Data integrity
		- **Analyse**
			- Data exploration, visualisation, and analysis
		- **Share**

	- **EMC Data Analysis Life Cycle (Dell)**
		- **Discovery**
		- **Pre-processing data**
		- **Model planning**
		- **Model building**
		- **Communicate results**
		- **Operationalise**
		- Phases aren't static milestones
		- Reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects
		- Helps analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward, and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases
			- Don't start modelling the data before it is ready
