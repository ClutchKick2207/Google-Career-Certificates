- **Why is Project Management important?**
	- Valuable to businesses as it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected outcomes both on time and in budget
	- *Example*
		- A school district signs a deal with a tele-health company to make sure students don't have to miss school for simple health issues
		- The deal is to be completed by the end of the school year
		- The students can interact with a doctor through a smart-device while they are at school
		- Implementing the technology to make this work is the *project*
			- It has a clear start and end date
		- *How is this project managed?*
			- Each one of the steps here has to be carefully planned (i.e. *managed*) in order for the project to be completed
			- This can be done via:
				- **Organise**
					- Organise a training session for staff to get them more used to the new technology, policy and procedures
				- **Budget**
					- For new tablets, computers, and other equipment that may be necessary
				- **Maintain strong communication**
					- With doctors, tele-health company, staff, students to make sure everything is working as planned
